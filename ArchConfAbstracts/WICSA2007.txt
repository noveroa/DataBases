Abstract: In this paper, we describe the importance of new Software/Enterprise architects in the discipline of Software Architecture and Enterprise Architecture. Both are often idealized as super heroes with a lot of qualities that are very infrequent in contemporary people. The Enterprise/Software Architect role could be assumed by a group of people able to manage the qualities for the role. In any case, even a group or a single person must be educated in the discipline by training courses, new methodologies of learning, or traditional university studies. In order to improve the process of becoming a new architect we propose a methodology based on ontological structures and reinforcement learning. © 2007 IEEE. (22 refs)

Abstract: Understanding and modeling architectural variability is fundamental in product line engineering. Various extensions have been proposed to architecture description languages (ADLs) to deal with variability. Although these extensions are useful, we argue in this paper that decisions need to be treated as first-class citizens for modeling architectural variability. Decisions that have to be taken by different stakeholders during product derivation are an essential source to understand the variability at different levels (e.g., features, architecture, and implementation). We outline a decision-oriented approach to variability modeling and illustrate it with an example from our ongoing research collaboration with Siemens VAI. © 2007 IEEE. (12 refs)

Abstract: In contrast to software architecture models, architectural decisions are often not explicitly documented, and therefore eventually lost. This contributes to major problems such as high-cost system evolution, stakeholders miscommunication, and limited reusability of core system assets. An approach is outlined that systematically and semiautomatically documents architectural decisions and allows them to be effectively shared by the stakeholders. A first attempt is presented that partially implements the approach by binding architectural decisions, models and the system implementation. The approach is demonstrated with an example demonstrating its usefulness with regards to some industrial use cases. © 2007 IEEE. (33 refs)

Abstract: While the relationship between Requirements Engineering and Software Architecture (SA) has been studied increasingly in the past five years in terms of methods, tools, development models, and paradigms, that in terms of the human agents conducting these processes has barely been explored. This paper describes the impact of requirements knowledge and experience (RKE) on SA tasks. Specifically, it describes an exploratory, empirical study involving a number of architecting teams, some with requirements background and others without, all architecting from the same set of requirements. The overall results of this study suggest that architects with RKE perform better than those without, and specific areas of architecting are identified where these differences manifest. We discuss the possible implications of the findings on the areas of training, education and technology. © 2007 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: In pervasive computing systems, a higher number of interactions will be mediated by computers, amplifying the menace to privacy. Privacy protection in pervasive environments is still a big issue, despite the growing number of works on this subject as evidenced by this survey. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy for privacy invasion attacks, classify existing privacy enhancing technologies according to the protection provided for those attacks, and introduce a service-oriented privacy-enhanced architecture for pervasive computing.

Abstract: Architectural knowledge is reflected in various artifacts of a software product. In the case of a software product audit this architectural knowledge needs to be uncovered and its effects assessed, in order to evaluate the quality of the software product. A particular problem is to find and comprehend the architectural knowledge that resides in the software product documentation. The amount of documents, and the differences in for instance target audience and level of abstraction, make it a difficult job for the auditors to find their way through the documentation. This paper discusses how the use of a technique called latent semantic analysis can guide the auditors through the documentation to the architectural knowledge they need. Using latent semantic analysis, we effectively construct a reading guide for software product audits. (20 refs)

Abstract: Offshoring is not as popular as it seems. According to a recent German survey, only 1.5% of all outsourcing activities target offshore locations. This is a remarkably small figure taking into account the widely published purported benefits of offshoring. In this paper we demonstrate that communication problems are at the core of offshoring woes. This does not come as a surprise as they also play a major role in onshore projects. Based on our experience in tackling these challenges with our well established communication-centered agile design and development approach, we present case-study-reinforced advice for successful offshore projects. We show that a common view of the underlying architecture is of paramount importance for these projects. © 2007 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: Since the first works involving software reuse, domain engineering is considered a key process to develop reusable and flexible software. However, the results have shown that there is still much to do before the vision of domain engineering is completely achieved. Among the reasons for this problem, we may highlight the lack of a process to support the design of domain-specific software architectures. This paper presents such an approach, based on a well defined set of principles, guidelines and metrics. © 2007 IEEE. (20 refs)

A failure to find a relationship between the business and mission goals of a system and the risk themes from an evaluation of that system. A failure to find a relationship between the domain of a system being evaluated and the risk themes associated with the development of that system. The results of this investigation have application to practitioners by suggesting activities on which developers should put greater focus. They also have application to researchers by suggesting further areas of investigation. © 2007 IEEE. (11 refs)

Abstract: Multi-site development organizations require coordination and communication efforts between different sites to ensure successful distributed development. These efforts need to be guided by a set of principles and statements on the software architecture that must be complied with throughout the organization: architectural rules. It is of paramount importance that multi-site development organizations incorporate measures in the architecting process to secure compliance with these rules throughout the organization. We describe a method to assess the degree to which compliance measures are secured in multi-site development organizations. We share our experience in applying this method in a large development organization in the consumer electronics domain. © 2007 IEEE. (14 refs)

Abstract: The share of software in embedded systems has been growing permanently in the recent years. Thus, software architecture as well as its evaluation has become an important part of embedded systems design to define, assess, and assure architecture and system quality. Furthermore, design space exploration can be based on architecture evaluation. To achieve an efficient exploration process, architectural decisions need to be well considered. In this paper, analysis of architecture evaluation is performed to uncover dependencies of the quality attributes which are the first class citizens of architecture evaluation. With an explicit representation of such dependencies, valuable changes of an architecture can be calculated. Next to the exploration support, the analysis results help to document architecture knowledge and make architectural decisions explicit and traceable. The development process can now be based on dependable and well documented architectural decisions. Effects of changes become more predictable. Time and costs can be saved by avoiding suboptimal changes. (15 refs)

Abstract: The dynamic generation of context-aware applications for the ubiquitous Web is very time consuming and causes significant server load. Therefore, optimizing the efficiency of the publishing process and reducing server load by dynamically configuring system components are key factors for the commercial success of context-aware Web applications. To meet this challenge, this paper presents a framework that dynamically adjusts the architecture of pipeline-based context-aware Web systems either by adapting or omitting server tasks, distributing load within server clusters, or migrating load to client devices. The system adaptation and distribution are performed according to varying load rates and system context states that are monitored permanently. Furthermore, the paper also presents experiences gained by the implementation of prototypes and illustrates several useful application scenarios that are supported by the proposed mechanisms.

Abstract: The software architecture is one of the most important artifacts created in the lifecycle of a software system. It enables, facilitates, hampers, or interferes directly the achievement of business goals, functional and quality requirements. One instrument to determine how adequate the architecture is for its intended usage is architecture compliance checking. This paper compares three static architecture compliance checking approaches (reflexion models, relation conformance rules, and component access rules) by assessing their applicability in 13 distinct dimensions. The results give guidance on when to use which approach. (21 refs)

Abstract: The MIDARCH Method is a software design method for exploring software architecture alternatives that use different middleware platforms. First, candidate architectures are modelled based on different architectural styles that are induced by the respective middleware platforms. Candidate styles are chosen using a taxonomy of such styles. The goal is the evaluation of candidate architectures with respect to a goal/question/metric quality model. We illustrate the modelling approach using the Apache Cocoon Web component framework and related technologies, and a taxonomy of their associated styles. © 2007 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: Architectural knowledge is reflected in various artifacts of a software product. In the case of a software product audit this architectural knowledge needs to be uncovered and its effects assessed, in order to evaluate the quality of the software product. A particular problem is to find and comprehend the architectural knowledge that resides in the software product documentation. The amount of documents, and the differences in for instance target audience and level of abstraction, make it a difficult job for the auditors to find their way through the documentation. This paper discusses how the use of a technique called Latent Semantic Analysis can guide the auditors through the documentation to the architectural knowledge they need. Using Latent Semantic Analysis, we effectively construct a reading guide for software product audits. © 2007 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: Software systems today are composed from prefabricated commercial components and connectors that provide complex functionality and engage in complex interactions. Unfortunately, because of the distinct assumptions made by developers of these products, successfully integrating them into a software system can be complicated, often causing budget and schedule overruns. A number of integration risks can often be resolved by selecting the ‘right ‘ set of COTS components and connectors that can be integrated with minimal effort. In this paper we describe a framework for selecting COTS software components and connectors ensuring their interoperability in softwareintensive systems. Our framework is built upon standard definitions of both COTS components and connectors and is intended for use by architects and developers during the design phase of a software system. We highlight the utility of our framework using a challenging example from the data-intensive systems domain. Our preliminary experience in using the framework indicates an increase in interoperability assessment productivity by 50% and accuracy by 20%. © 2007 IEEE. (23 refs)

Abstract: Much research in the software architecture field has focused on the purely technical aspects of architecting: architectural styles, documentation, analysis, architecture description languages, reverse engineering, and so forth. In this working session we seek to explore a less exhaustively studied, but equally important, realm: architectural competence. What defines a competent software architect? And equally important, what defines an architecturally competent software development organization? In particular, we seek to better understand the following issues: What do architects actually do on a day-to-day basis? What skills and knowledge must a competent architect have? What does it mean to be a competent architect? What can an organization do to get the best performance from its software architects? How can we measure architectural competence of an individual or an organization and how can we increase this? Our goal for this working session is to propose an initial “theory” of architectural competence, even if very informally rendered, and then provide some practical guidance deriving from that theory to practicing architects (and to those who aspire to be architects), as well as technical managers in software development organizations. © 2007 IEEE.

Abstract: Multi-site development organizations require coordination and communication efforts between different sites to ensure successful distributed development. These efforts need to be guided by a set of principles and statements on the software architecture that must be complied with throughout the organization: architectural rules. It is of paramount importance that multi-site development organizations incorporate measures in the architecting process to secure compliance with these rules throughout the organization. We describe a method to assess the degree to which compliance measures are secured in multi-site development organizations. We share our experience in applying this method in a large development organization in the consumer electronics domain. (14 refs)

Abstract: A common approach to defining architectural views is to have independent heterogeneous representations that are tailored to each view’s purpose, but this makes reconciling views into an overall architectural description harder. In this paper we put forward a complementary (not alternative) approach in which some views are derived from a given architecture description language (ADL) in a systematic way, by listing the design questions each view should answer. The approach is based on constructing the language’s metamodel and extending it with the entities and associations needed to capture and explicitly relate the required views. (23 refs)

Abstract: Modern software development practices show that there is significant diversity in the product, process and geographical location of software development due to economical, technical and logistical constraints. Such diverse development demands flexibility in the software engineering methodology. In this paper, we propose the Cellular Development Methodology (CDM), an architecture-driven approach to flexible software development. CDM derives the development process and its architecture from the software architecture of product. The software development process is structured and customised as a network of cooperating cells. Our contribution is a cellular approach to software development based on the software architecture of the end product whereby a network of configurable cells yield customisable, potentially distributed software development processes which in turn produce software that is highly tailored to user requirements. © 2007 IEEE.

Abstract: Quality-aware service delivery has been receiving increasing attention in both software architecture and service management. Our approach values software and service quality assurance, ranging from quality assessment in software architecting to quality matching in service discovery. This paper proposes an integrated QoS-aware service management method, which examines the ‘service as a software’ development and the ‘software as a service’ management against QoS requirements. Moreover, we design an integrated QoS-aware service management infrastructure which promises complete software and service workflow management coupled with a QoS ontology development. We develop the QoS property ontology from the viewpoints of technical quality and managerial quality information management. © 2007 IEEE. (45 refs)

Abstract: The share of software in embedded systems has been growing permanently in the recent years. Thus, software architecture as well as its evaluation has become an important part of embedded systems design to define, assess, and assure architecture and system quality. Furthermore, design space exploration can be based on architecture evaluation. To achieve an efficient exploration process, architectural decisions need to be well considered. In this paper, analysis of architecture evaluation is performed to uncover dependencies of the quality attributes which are the first class citizens of architecture evaluation. With an explicit representation of such dependencies, valuable changes of an architecture can be calculated. Next to the exploration support, the analysis results help to document architecture knowledge and make architectural decisions explicit and traceable. The development process can now be based on dependable and well documented architectural decisions. Effects of changes become more predictable. Time and costs can be saved by avoiding suboptimal changes. © 2007 IEEE. (15 refs)

Abstract: While the relationship between Requirements Engineering and software architecture (SA) has been studied increasingly in the past five years in terms of methods, tools, development models, and paradigms, that in terms of the human agents conducting these processes has barely been explored. This paper describes the impact of requirements knowledge and experience (RKE) on SA tasks. Specifically, it describes an exploratory, empirical study involving a number of architecting teams, some with requirements background and others without, all architecting from the same set of requirements. The overall results of this study suggest that architects with RKE perform better than those without, and specific areas of architecting are identified where these differences manifest. We discuss the possible implications of the findings on the areas of training, education and technology. (20 refs)

Abstract: While typical solutions focus on fault tolerance (and specifically, exception handling) during the design and implementation phases of the software life-cycle (e.g., Java and Windows NT exception handling), more recently the need for explicit exception handling solutions during the entire life cycle has been advocated by some researchers. Several solutions have been proposed for fault tolerance via exception handling at the software architecture and component levels. This paper describes how the two concepts of fault tolerance and software architectures have been integrated so far. It is structured in two parts (overview on fault tolerance and exception handling, and integrating fault tolerance into software architecture) and is based on a survey study on architecting fault tolerant systems where more than fifteen approaches have been analyzed and classified. This paper concludes by identifying those issues that remain still open and require deeper investigation.

Abstract: The intertwining of Requirements and Software Architectures must be based on solid traceability mechanisms in order to effectively maintain the consistency between the two specifications. A new issue has come to the fore in this area: Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD). Achieving the separation of concerns from the very beginning of software development along with their proper traceability throughout the lifecycle is mandatory in terms of quality and maintainability. ATRIUM is a methodology that is defined to guide the development of architectures from requirements and using AOSD techniques as its cornerstone. In this work, we present how ATRIUM uses a scenario technique that provides traceability support. ATRIUM pays special attention to non-functional requirements, their crosscutting relationships, and how they can derive aspects in the software architecture. (19 refs)

Abstract: A new breed of Web application, dubbed AJAX, is emerging in response to a limited degree of interactivity in large-grain stateless Web interactions. At the heart of this new approach lies a single page interaction model that facilitates rich interactivity. We have studied and experimented with several AJAX frameworks trying to understand their architectural properties. In this paper, we summarize three of these frameworks and examine their properties and introduce the Spiar architectural style. We describe the guiding software engineering principles and the constraints chosen to induce the desired properties. The style emphasizes user interface component development, and intermediary delta-communication between client/server components, to improve user interactivity and ease of development. In addition, we use the concepts and principles to discuss various open issues in AJAX frameworks and application development. (31 refs)

Abstract: Software models are, in most cases, considered as functional abstractions of systems. They represent the backbone of transformational processes aimed at code generation. On the other end, modeling is a traditional activity in the field of non-functional validation of software/hardware systems, although non-functional models found on different notations (such as Petri Nets) and embed additional information (such as the operational profile) with respect to software models. In this paper we widen the scope of model-driven architecture by introducing a Non-Functional-MDA framework that, beside the typical model transformations for code generation, embeds new types of model transformations that allow to generate non-functional models. For an uniform integration of these practices, we define Platform Independent/Specific Models in the non-functional domain. (11 refs)

Abstract: Since the first works involving software reuse, domain engineering is considered a key process to develop reusable and flexible software. However, the results have shown that there is still much to do before the vision of domain engineering is completely achieved. Among the reasons for this problem, we may highlight the lack of a process to support the design of domain-specific software architectures. This paper presents such an approach, based on a well defined set of principles, guidelines and metrics. (20 refs)

Abstract: This paper presents an assessment case study on the evolutionary capability of a large software system using a knowledge-based approach. The knowledge-based assessment is based on interviews with selected stakeholders of a software system. We have used this to assess the capability of the software architecture to evolve in one large Nokia software system. We have found that this approach proves to be effective in large organizations where development teams are distributed in different time-zones, with cultural differences and with limited person-to person communication. The lessons learned and the advantages of using this approach are presented. © 2007 IEEE. (26 refs)

Abstract: Even though there has been some research on system evolution, there is no well defined vocabulary to indicate deviation of a system from desired goals. Further, there are no objective measures to indicate whether changes incorporated into a system as part of its evolution violates the integrity of the architectural design. Also, little research has been done to categorize the aspects of a software system that is subject to deviation as the system evolves. In this paper we develop a model for tracking software evolution and propose measures that will objectively indicate the extent of deviation or divergence in a software system. We also categorize the different aspects of software, changes to which can significantly impact usability as well as conceptual coherence. (15 refs)

Abstract: It has been well documented that there is a correlation between the structure of an architecture and the organization that produces it. More concretely there is a correlation between task interdependencies and coordination among the people or teams realizing these tasks. The amount of coordination needed among teams is related to the nature of these task interdependencies. As the scale and complexity of organization and systems grow it is not uncommon to have factors such as geographic boundaries, organization boundaries, cultural differences, and so forth impede the ability of certain individuals or teams to coordinate effectively. While there is some understanding of the factors that impede the ability of teams to coordinate, the factors that cause task interdependence in software systems is less well understood. The current view is that it is the interactions across module boundaries (assuming a module is assigned as a task or work item to a single team) that cause task interdependence; we have found that this view is not sufficient. In this paper we present three cases where additional architectural mechanisms created task interdependencies that the organizations were unable to accommodate. We go on to discuss the implications of these findings and suggest future research activities. (13 refs)

Abstract: A distributed software system uses a complex system of resources which work together to process a request. A typical web-based request flows through various servers including Web servers, database servers, Java application servers, etc, deployed on various hardware platforms. Such a request encounters various forms of delays at and between these servers: communication delay, processing delay and queueing delay. Queueing delay is incurred at every point where there is any contention for resources, e.g. for acquiring a thread, or the CPU, or the lock to a log file. Queueing delay depends on the rate at which requests arrive for that particular resource, which in turn depends on the user behavior, the flow of the request, and the deployment of the servers. Given the number and type of soft and hard resources that make up a distributed system, it is a non-trivial task to quantify these delays. To address this problem, a number of methodologies and tools have been proposed, which allow a distributed system to be specified at a high level, and which generate and solve an underlying model using queueing theory techniques, to answer questions such as what the response time of a request is, what the bottleneck server is, and so on. In this tutorial we will review the state-of-the art in methods and tools for modeling and analyzing distributed software systems. This includes: Motivating examples of web-based multi-tier server systems Queueing systems primer (M/M/c/K, M/G/1 etc). Simple examples of application of queueing theory to software servers Introductory example of the “layered queueing network” method Overview of generalized software performance modeling methods and tools Real-life applicability of modeling methodologies: comparisons with measured performance.

40. An architectural framework for non functional requirements in enterprise SOA adoption

Abstract: Summary form only given. Service oriented architecture (SAO) is latest trend in trying to bridge the gap between business strategists and IT architects. Architecting services from an enterprise perspective does not just involve identifying and fitting pieces together, but managing and addressing cross cutting concerns or non functional requirements (NFRs). With most of the discussion on SOA being around abstracting the business functions as reuse-able services, IT architects have to additionally worry about the existing system qualities. So, a flat view over services has to be complimented with an approach of looking into these additional obligations, which adds a new dimension of complexity during the adoption of SOA. This tutorial is intended to provide our insights into managing this complexity throughout the different phases of SOA adoption, by minimizing the risk through calculated assumptions. We will initially set the context of the different phases of service adoption. We will then present an approach for managing the complexities of NFRs through earlier defined adoption phases. We will conclude with a discussion of the essential artifacts and tools for guiding service design. (0 refs)

41. Best practices for writing and managing performance, reliability, and availability requirements

Abstract: Summary form only given. Functional requirements refer to how a piece of a system functions or what it does given specific inputs. Nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) refer to such business and engineering needs as performance, reliability, availability, stability, usability, compatibility with interfaces, and security. They are crucial inputs for architects and system designers when performing such tasks as specifying information flows, defining deployment scenarios, choosing software platforms, sizing system configurations, determining required levels of redundancy, and identifying system measurement instrumentation. NFRs that have been clearly and succinctly written contribute to the success of a project by reducing the time required to understand them and to devise and implement procedures for ensuring and verifying that they have been met. By contrast, poorly written NFRs can lead to confusion among developers and architects, resulting in much wasted time, or to the failure and cancellation of a project, especially if the delivered system crashes often or runs too slowly. The focus of this tutorial is quantitative nonfunctional requirements relating to performance, reliability, and availability (PRA). In this tutorial, we shall look at criteria for high-quality PRA NFRs, including algebraic consistency, measurability, testability, and linkage to business and engineering needs. We shall show methods for presenting and managing PRA NFRs that will improve their chances of being accepted by architects, developers, contract negotiators, and purchasers; and of their being successfully implemented and tested. Attendees will be invited to participate in exercises in which they will interpret and draft PRA NFRs and develop procedures for validating them. (0 refs)

Abstract: The intertwining of Requirements and Software Architectures must be based on solid traceability mechanisms in order to effectively maintain the consistency between the two specifications. A new issue has come to the fore in this area: Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD). Achieving the separation of concerns from the very beginning of software development along with their proper traceability throughout the lifecycle is mandatory in terms of quality and maintainability. ATRIUM is a methodology that is defined to guide the development of architectures from requirements and using AOSD techniques as its cornerstone. In this work, we present how ATRIUM uses a scenario technique that provides traceability support. ATRIUM pays special attention to non-functional requirements, their crosscutting relationships, and how they can derive aspects in the software architecture. © 2007 IEEE. (19 refs)

Abstract: Several Software Architecture Design Methods (SADM) have been published, reviewed, and compared. But these surveys and comparisons are mostly centered on intrinsic elements of the design method, and they do not compare them from the perspective of the actual needs of software architects. We would like to analyze the completeness of SADM from an architect’s point of view. To do so, we define nine categories of software architects’ needs, propose an ordinal scale for evaluating the degree to which a given SADM meets the needs, and then apply this to a small set of SADMs. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (i) to provide a different and useful frame of reference for architects to select SADM, and (H) to suggest SADM areas of improvements. We found two answers to our question: “do architectural design methods meet the needs of the architect?” Yes, all architect’s needs are met by one or another SADM, but No, no architectural design method meets simultaneously all the needs of an architect. This approach may lead to improvements of existing SADMs. © 2007 IEEE. (49 refs)

Abstract: Offshoring is not as popular as it seems. According to a recent German survey, only 1.5% of all outsourcing activities target offshore locations. This is a remarkably small figure taking into account the widely published purported benefits of offshoring. In this paper we demonstrate that communication problems are at the core of offshoring woes. This does not come as a surprise as they also play a major role in onshore projects. Based on our experience in tackling these challenges with our well established communication-centered agile design and development approach, we present case-study-reinforced advice for successful offshore projects. We show that a common view of the underlying architecture is of paramount importance for these projects. (10 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the importance of new software/enterprise architects in the discipline of software architecture and enterprise architecture. Both are often idealized as super heroes with a lot of qualities that are very infrequent in contemporary people. The enterprise/software architect role could be assumed by a group of people able to manage the qualities for the role. In any case, even a group or a single person must be educated in the discipline by training courses, new methodologies of learning, or traditional university studies.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling architectural variability is fundamental in product line engineering. Various extensions have been proposed to architecture description languages (ADLs) to deal with variability. Although these extensions are useful, we argue in this paper that decisions need to be treated as first-class citizens for modeling architectural variability. Decisions that have to be taken by different stakeholders during product derivation are an essential source to understand the variability at different levels (e.g., features, architecture, and implementation). We outline a decision-oriented approach to variability modeling and illustrate it with an example from our ongoing research collaboration with Siemens VAI. (12 refs)

Abstract: Software systems today are composed from prefabricated commercial components and connectors that provide complex functionality and engage in complex interactions. Unfortunately, because of the distinct assumptions made by developers of these products, successfully integrating them into a software system can be complicated, often causing budget and schedule overruns. A number of integration risks can often be resolved by selecting the ‘right’ set of COTS components and connectors that can be integrated with minimal effort. In this paper we describe a framework for selecting COTS software components and connectors ensuring their interoperability in software-intensive systems. Our framework is built upon standard definitions of both COTS components and connectors and is intended for use by architects and developers during the design phase of a software system. We highlight the utility of our framework using a challenging example from the data-intensive systems domain. Our preliminary experience in using the framework indicates an increase in interoperability assessment productivity by 50% and accuracy by 20%. (23 refs)

Abstract: Even though there has been some research on system evolution, there is no well defined vocabulary to indicate deviation of a system from desired goals. Further, there are no objective measures to indicate whether changes incorporated into a system as part of its evolution violates the integrity of the architectural design. Also, little research has been done to categorize the aspects of a software system that is subject to deviation as the system evolves. In this paper we develop a model for tracking software evolution and propose measures that will objectively indicate the extent of deviation or divergence in a software system. We also categorize the different aspects of software, changes to which can significantly impact usability as well as conceptual coherence. © 2007 IEEE. (15 refs)

Abstract: The dynamic generation of context-aware applications for the ubiquitous Web is very time consuming and causes significant server load. Therefore, optimizing the efficiency of the publishing process and reducing server load by dynamically configuring system components are key factors for the commercial success of context-aware Web applications. To meet this challenge, this paper presents a framework that dynamically adjusts the architecture of pipeline-based context-aware Web systems either by adapting or omitting server tasks, distributing load within server clusters, or migrating load to client devices. The system adaptation and distribution are performed according to varying load rates and system context states that are monitored permanently. Furthermore, the paper also presents experiences gained by the implementation of prototypes and illustrates several useful application scenarios that are supported by the proposed mechanisms. © 2007 IEEE.

Abstract: Several Software Architecture Design Methods (SADM) have been published, reviewed, and compared. But these surveys and comparisons are mostly centered on intrinsic elements of the design method, and they do not compare them from the perspective of the actual needs of software architects. We would like to analyze the completeness of SADM from an architect’s point of view. To do so, we define nine categories of software architects’ needs, propose an ordinal scale for evaluating the degree to which a given SADM meets the needs, and then apply this to a small set of SADMs. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (i) to provide a different and useful frame of reference for architects to select SADM, and (ii) to suggest SADM areas of improvements. We found two answers to our question: “do architectural design methods meet the needs of the architect?” Yes, all architect’s needs are met by one or another SADM, but No, no architectural design method meets simultaneously all the needs of an architect. This approach may lead to improvements of existing SADMs. (49 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. Software architecture has become a widely-accepted conceptual basis for the development of non-trivial software in all application areas and by organizations of all sizes. Effectively evaluating architecture is as important as crafting it in order to have assurance that it successfully addresses the target system qualities, which in turn, help fulfill the business goals of the system. We present the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM), a practical and comprehensive approach for evaluating software architectures that is based on the principles of quality attributes and architectural tactics. We have gained experience with the approach by analyzing the architecture of several systems, and the ATAM is now a standard practice in many large companies. (0 refs)

Abstract: A new breed of web application, dubbed AJAX, is emerging in response to a limited degree of interactivity in large-grain stateless Web interactions. At the heart of this new approach lies a single page interaction model that facilitates rich interactivity. We have studied and experimented with several AJAX frameworks trying to understand their architectural properties. In this paper, we summarize three of these frameworks and examine their properties and introduce the S PIAR architectural style. We describe the guiding software engineering principles and the constraints chosen to induce the desired properties. The style emphasizes user interface component development, and intermediary delta-communication between client/server components, to improve user interactivity and ease of development. In addition, we use the concepts and principles to discuss various open issues in AJAX frameworks and application development. © 2007 IEEE. (31 refs)

Abstract: Software models are, in most cases considered as functional abstractions of systems. They represent the backbone of transformational processes aimed at code generation. On the other end, modeling is a traditional activity in the field of non-functional validation of software/hardware systems, although non-functional models found on different notations (such as Petri Nets) and embed additional information (such as the operational profile) with respect to software models. In this paper we widen the scope of Model-Driven Architecture by introducing a Non-Functional-MDA framework that, beside the typical model transformations for code generation, embeds new types of model transformations that allow to generate non-functional models. For an uniform integration of these practices, we define Platform Independent/Specific Models in the non-functional domain. © 2007 IEEE. (11 refs)

Such refactoring helps ensure that software is more easily changeable, and the costs of development and maintenance are reduced. This tutorial addresses (a) refactoring techniques that a developer can employ during design and coding and (b) static analysis techniques that detect opportunities for refactoring. (0 refs)

Abstract: Quality-aware service delivery has been receiving increasing attention in both software architecture and service management. Our approach values software and service quality assurance, ranging from quality assessment in software architecting to quality matching in service discovery. This paper proposes an integrated QoS-aware service management method, which examines the ‘service as a software’ development and the ‘software as a service’ management against QoS requirements. Moreover, we design an integrated QoS-aware service management infrastructure which promises complete software and service workflow management coupled with a QoS ontology development. We develop the QoS property ontology from the viewpoints of technical quality and managerial quality information management. (45 refs)

Abstract: This tutorial uses design patterns to present techniques for implementing effective and efficient resource management in a system. The tutorial is based on the third volume of the POSA (pattern-oriented software architecture) series. The tutorial presents a thorough introduction to resource management along with two case studies in which the patterns are applied to the domains of ad hoc networking and mobile radio networks. The presented patterns are independent of any implementation technique, such as .NET, Java or C++, even though the examples are given in Java and C++. The patterns are grouped by different areas of resource management and address the complete lifecycle of resources: acquisition, management, and release. (0 refs)

Abstract: Modern software development practices show that there is significant diversity in the product, process and geographical location of software development due to economical, technical and logistical constraints. Such diverse development demands flexibility in the software engineering methodology. In this paper, we propose the cellular development methodology (CDM), an architecture-driven approach to flexible software development. CDM derives the development process and its architecture from the software architecture of product. The software development process is structured and customised as a network of cooperating cells. Our contribution is a cellular approach to software development based on the software architecture of the end product whereby a network of configurable cells yield customisable, potentially distributed software development processes which in turn produce software that is highly tailored to user requirements.

Abstract: The Views and Beyond (V&B) approach to software architecture provides practical guidance on the what, why, and how of creating IEEE 1471-2000 compliant documentation for your software architecture that will be used for years to come. The approach is based on the well-known concept of views and is presented in the context of prevailing prescriptive models for architecture, including the unified process and UML 2.0, which has improved support for representing key architectural elements over its predecessors. In this paper, students will be introduced to the views and beyond approach and will gain hands-on experience creating a new architectural style using the V&B style guide and learn how to document an architectural view in that style using the V&B view template. This paper concludes with a discussion of tool support for architectural documentation and a demo of a Web-based documentation system. (0 refs)

Abstract: A common approach to defining architectural views is to have independent heterogeneous representations that are tailored to each view’s purpose, but this makes reconciling views into an overall architectural description harder. In this paper we put forward a complementary (not alternative) approach in which some views are derived from a given architecture description language (ADL) in a systematic way, by listing the design questions each view should answer. The approach is based on constructing the language’s metamodel and extending it with the entities and associations needed to capture and explicitly relate the required views. © 2007 IEEE. (23 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. Architecture has been established as a key to developing software systems that meet quality expectations of their stakeholders. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) methodologies, however, treat architecture only indirectly or implicitly. The quality of systems developed using such methodologies, thus, depends largely on the skill level and experience of its architect. It has been suggested, therefore, that augmenting these methodologies with software architecture-centric methods such as the Quality Attribute Workshop (QAW) and Attribute Driven Design (ADD) can provide explicit and methodical guidance to an architect in creating systems with desirable qualities.

Abstract: Summary form only given. This tutorial will present a practical technique for managing the architecture of large software systems using Dependency Models. We will demonstrate that the matrix representation used by these models provides a unique view of the architecture and is highly scalable compared to the directed graph approaches that are common today. We will also show a variety of matrix algorithms that can be applied to analyze and organize the system into a form that reflects key architectural patterns and highlights problematic dependencies. We will illustrate our approach by applying it to real applications each consisting of hundreds or thousands of subsystems. The dependency model will be formally specified using design rules which enable architectural violations to be identified automatically. Finally, actual dependency models will be created for multiple generations of a software application to highlight how architecture evolves and how it often begins to degrade. (0 refs)

Abstract: The output of 18 software architecture evaluations are analyzed to find patterns in the risk themes identified in the evaluations. The major results are: i) A categorization of risk themes ii) The observation that twice as many risk themes are risks of “omission “ as are risks of “commission “. iii) A failure to find a relationship between the business and mission goals of a system and the risk themes from an evaluation of that system. iv) A failure to find a relationship between the domain of a system being evaluated and the risk themes associated with the development of that system. The results of this investigation have application to practitioners by suggesting activities on which developers should put greater focus. They also have application to researchers by suggesting further areas of investigation. (11 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. In this tutorial, we highlight the benefits and challenges in capturing and managing software architecture knowledge for supporting an architecture-centric software development process. We discuss various approaches to characterize software architecture knowledge based on the requirements of a particular domain. We describe various concepts and approaches to manage the software architecture knowledge from both management and technical perspectives. We also demonstrate the utility of captured architecture knowledge to support software architecture activities with a case study covering the use of architecture knowledge management techniques and tools in an industrial project. The specific architecture knowledge management technology used during the tutorial is BRedB, a software tool developed in National ICT Australia. Finally, the ways in which Wikis can be used to manage architecture knowledge are discussed. (0 refs)

Abstract: This paper presents an assessment case study on the evolutionary capability of a large software system using a knowledge-based approach. The knowledge-based assessment is based on interviews with selected stakeholders of a software system. We have used this to assess the capability of the software architecture to evolve in one large Nokia software system. We have found that this approach proves to be effective in large organizations where development teams are distributed in different time-zones, with cultural differences and with limited person-to person communication. The lessons learned and the advantages of using this approach are presented. (26 refs)

Abstract: Much research in the software architecture field has focused on the purely technical aspects of architecting: architectural styles, documentation, analysis, architecture description languages, reverse engineering, and so forth. In this working session we seek to explore a less exhaustively studied, but equally important, realm: architectural competence. What defines a competent software architect? And equally important, what defines an architecturally competent software development organization? In particular, we seek to better understand the following issues: (a) What do architects actually do on a day-to-day basis? (b) What skills and knowledge must a competent architect have? (c) What does it mean to be a competent architect? (d) What can an organization do to get the best performance from its software architects? (e) How can we measure architectural competence of an individual or an organization and how can we increase this? Our goal for this working session is to propose an initial “theory” of architectural competence, even if very informally rendered, and then provide some practical guidance deriving from that theory to practicing architects (and to those who aspire to be architects), as well as technical managers in software development organizations.
