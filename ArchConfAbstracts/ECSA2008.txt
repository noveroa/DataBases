Abstract: The first European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA ‘2007) held in Aranjuez, Spain received 62 paper submissions, where finally the research of only five papers were presented. These papers were exhibited during sessions as architecture description and evolution, architecture analysis, architecture based approaches and applications, challenges in software architecture, and service oriented architectures. Professor David Garlan, from Carneige Mellon University in his keynote exposed the need to use high level architectural descriptions to achieve task-oriented computing. Some sessions presented showed the inspiration by aspect-oriented concepts, while others were directly supported by model-driven techniques. The conference also presented sixteen posters devoted to different topics, with a variety of approaches, their nature, as well as their intertwining of their topics. The ECSA series of conference is expected to be continued for years to build on the cooperation in the industry. (1 refs)

Abstract: Exchange Carriers Standards Association (ECSA) developed synchronous optical network (SONET) for ANSI. Synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) is the international equivalent of SONET. These standards define the optical telecommunication transport for the U.S. and European Telecommunications. The SONET and SDH are technologies for network transport. They use synchronous operations in facilitating real-time data, voice, and video transmission through fiber optic cabling. The rates range from 51.84 Mbps (OC-1 or optical carrier level 1) to 13.271 Gbps (OC-255). High-speed communications from different vendors are interconnected by applying the SONET standard. The ability of SONET to transport many different digital signals using a standard synchronous transport signal (STS) format is its major attribute. We will discuss the SONET and SDH in this chapter. The SONET signal, frame, components, topologies, and standards will also be discussed. (0 refs)

Abstract: Pt25Cu75 and Pt20Cu20Co 60 electrochemically dealloyed electrocatalysts were shown to possess improved resistance to electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss relative to commercially available Pt/HSC and Pt/Vu catalysts. The difference in ECSA loss was shown to be directly related to the temperature at which the alloy catalysts were prepared (i.e. reduced/annealed), with higher temperatures resulting in greater resistance to ECSA loss. To normalize for preparation conditions, commercially available catalysts were exposed to a heat treatment process mimicking the annealing/reducing procedure for the Pt alloys. © The; Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: Based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and KEM-DEM hybrid encryption construction, a novel certificateless hybrid encryption scheme is proposed. Elliptic Curve Signature Algorithm(ECSA) is used to provide unforgeability of user public key. Owing to KEM-DEM construction user public key is used to generate session key and session key encapsulation. Plaintext is encrypted by symmetry encryption scheme with session kev. which provides the confidentiality of plaintext without the strict limitation for plaintext message space. Tin’ main operations is point operation in elliptic curve. Compared with previous certificateless encryption schemes related to bilinear pairing operation the scheme is more efficient on computation.

Abstract: Developing corrosion resistant carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) supported Pt catalysts with optimized particle size is important for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. We investigated the effects of deposition technique (conventional refluxing and microwave irradiation), water content, carbon support and metal loading on the average Pt particle size and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). BET surface area measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize all the CNT/CNF supported catalysts. Processing was accelerated via microwave irradiation without significantly affecting Pt particle size as compared to conventional refluxing especially for high surface area CNT supported low Pt loading (10 wt%) catalyst. Adjusting the water content during synthesis effectively controlled the Pt particle size and size distribution regardless of the heating method, carbon support and metal loading. The ECSA of the samples was found to be dependent on Pt particle size which further depends on the water content during synthesis, support surface area and Pt loading. Optimization of deposition conditions leads to higher ECSA than seen in a commercially available carbon black supported catalyst. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (34 refs)

Abstract: Voltammetrically dealloyed Pt-Cu alloy nanoparticles show significantly improved Pt-mass and specific activities for the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media in both RDE and MEA configurations1-4. The active phase of the catalyst is prepared from Cu-rich precursor materials which are formulated into catalyst inks and electrode layers. The high Cu content of the precursor materials raises fundamental and practical questions as to the molecular stability / oxidation state of the Cu rich catalyst surface and the shelf-life of precursor powders, inks and electrode layers. Here we present: aging studies of a carbon-supported Pt25Cu75 nanoparticle catalyst precursor. We monitored how the surface area (ECSA) and the oxygen electroreduction (ORR) reactivity of dealloyed precursors (active form of catalyst) change as a function of the exposure time to air of the Pt 25Cu75 precursor at room temperature. Similarly, we aimed to investigate how ECSA and ORR of the active catalyst changed with the time the liquid catalyst ink was exposed to air. We find little detrimental effect of air aging of the precursor on ORR activity over the time scales investigated. The effect of air aging of the catalyst inks is more complex, however. Initially, aged inks show increased ORR reactivity, that is, aged inks result in more active catalyst layers. After about 4-5 days of aging of the inks in air, however, we observed a drop in ORR activity of the resulting catalyst layers. This complex aging behavior of the inks seems independent of prior air aging of the dry powder precursor. © The Electrochemical Society. (12 refs)

Abstract: Although the technologies used to implement and assemble components have improved significantly in recent years, techniques for verifying systems created from them have changed very little. In fact, the correctness and reliability of component-based systems are still usually checked using the traditional testing techniques employed before components and services became widespread. These techniques are not only expensive because they treat a system as a monolithic black box, they are not very helpful because they fail to use architectural knowledge to pin-point the source of failures. As a result, many of the potential benefits of component-based development are outweighed by the costs involved in verifying the resulting systems. In this talk, Colin Atkinson will present an approach that addresses this problem by making the system verification process component-oriented as well. Based on the notion of built-in tests - tests that are packaged with components and are executed at run-time - the approach reduces the level of manual effort needed to verify a system by partially automating the testing process. It involves a method to define how services/components should be written to support and exploit built-in tests, and a resource-aware infrastructure that arranges for tests to be executed when they have a minimal impact on the delivery of system services.

11. Issues in architecture evolution: using design intent in maintenance and controlling dynamic evolution

Abstract: Issues in architecture evolution: 1) Using design intent in maintenance & 2) Controlling dynamic evolution In this keynote talk I will address two issues in software architecture evolution. In Alex Wolfs and my original architecture model, we proposed rationale as one of the major components. Over the years very little has been explored about this issue. The primary purpose of rationale was to record architecture design intent: why are things the way they are? It is only recently that architecture researchers have become interested in capturing design intent. Unfortunately the focus has been (as it was in the 80’s on capturing design decisions) on what can we capture and how. I will focus instead on the problem of what design intent do we need when we evolve the architecture design and discuss the work I am doing with my student Paul Grisham. There are a number of interesting contexts where the dynamic evolution of software architectures are of critical importance - for example, self-managing, self-adapting systems, etc. Another interesting context is that of simulating very large, very complex systems. In all these cases, the control of dynamic architecture evolution is a critical issue. In the case of complex simulations we have foreknowledge (indeed, control) of the desired architecture evolution. I will focus on our approach in handling this issue in this context. While this is a fairly narrow context, I believe our approach has applicability in a wider context. (0 refs)

Abstract: Despite the well-known advantages of applying the MDA proposal to SOA developments, there are still some gaps that need to be filled. At PIM-level, for example, there is no possibility of having an executable version of the system as it solely comprises technologically independent models. In order to solve this we propose to formalize the architectural model at this level with p-ADL, an ADL supporting the description of dynamic and evolvable architectures like SOA itself is. Since p-ADL allows the definition of executable versions of the architecture, the specification written embodies a prototype of the system at the PIM-level. We illustrate this by describing a real case study based on the SMPP standard for sending SMS messages. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (11 refs)

Abstract: Architectural patterns have an impact on both the structure and the behavior of a system at the architecture design level. However, it is challenging to model patterns’ behavior in a systematic way because modeling languages do not provide the appropriate abstractions and because each pattern addresses a whole solution space comprised of potentially infinite solution variants. In this paper, we advocate the use of architectural primitives for systematically modeling architectural patterns in the behavioral view. These architectural primitives are found among a number of architectural patterns and serve as the basic building blocks for modeling patterns’ behavior. The main contribution of this work lies in the discovery of architectural primitives, defining architectural primitives using UML, and capturing the missing pattern semantics by using UML’s stereotypes. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Enterprise Architecture (EA) is increasingly being used by large organizations to get a grip on the complexity and inflexibility of their business processes, information systems and technical infrastructure. Although seen as an important instrument to help solve major organizational problems, effectively applying EA seems no easy task. Efficient collaboration between architects and EA stakeholders is one of the main critical success factors for EA. The basis for efficient collaboration between architects and EA stakeholders is mutual understanding. In EA research, there has been much focus on the role of the architect; there is little research on the EA stakeholder. In this article we present the cognitive structure of four EA stakeholder groups, revealing how they expect the EA function to help them achieve their goals. With this we gain understanding of the EA stakeholder and provide the basis for better collaboration between architects and EA stakeholders. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (21 refs)

Abstract: Web Services (WS) are an alternative to the lack of interoperability of applications, to facilitate integration via Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The main goal of this paper is to establish a correspondence between three WS-related standards, WSA (Web Services Architecture) representing industrial and marketing requirements, ISO/IEC 9126-1 quality model to specify standard quality requirements, and ISO/IEC 13236 to specify the measurement model for WS-based applications. A domain analysis process is defined to provide guidelines to integrate the information of the three standards, facilitating the automatic generation of standardized quality of service contracts between clients and providers. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: A typical software architecture design process requires the architects to make various trade-off architecture decisions. The architects need to consider different possibilities and combinations of tactics and patterns to satisfy the elicited quality scenarios of the intended software system, some of which may be conflicting or inconsistent in nature. The formation of the correct composition of these elements of architecture decisions for the satisfaction of the quality scenarios can be considered an important art of the architect; however, in cases where the architect is dealing with multiple stakeholders with inconsistent preferences, this can be an awkward task. In this paper, we formalize this process as a complex multi-attribute decision making procedure within the Attribute Driven Design methodology. In such a context, we are able to incrementally elicit the communal preferences of the stakeholders with regards to the available quality scenarios and hence assist the software architect in methodically making the architecture decisions with the highest expected utility for the stakeholders.We will also introduce our implementation of a decision support system, which embodies the methods proposed in this paper, along with a case study. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: This paper presents a dependency constraint language that allows software architects to restrict the spectrum of dependencies that can be presented in a given software system. The ultimate goal is to provide designers with means to define acceptable and unacceptable dependencies according to the planned system architecture. Once defined, such restrictions will be automatically enforced by a tool, thus avoiding silent erosions in the architecture. The paper also presents first results of applying the language in a Web-based system. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (13 refs)

Abstract: The use of agents is spreading as a means to develop different kinds of software systems, among which we can find Intelligent Virtual Environments for Training. The agent community has already started to pay attention to software engineering issues to develop agent-oriented systems, but they are mainly focused on methodologies and, to some extent, design patterns. However, not much attention has been paid to software architecture for the moment. We compare two agent-based software architectures for Intelligent Virtual Environments for Training that are intended to be easily extended and modified. The first one was designed using an organizational approach recommended by some agent oriented methodologies. The second one is a redesign of the first architecture using more formal principles and methods of software architecture design. A comparison between both architectures highlights the need to pay more attention to software architecture design in this field. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (35 refs)

Abstract: Software systems evolvability is more and more required in current software developments, in order to provide systems with enough flexibility to adapt to future requirements. The evolvability in the field of Software Architecture can be classified into two kinds: dynamic reconfiguration or dynamic architectural type evolution. The former enables an architecture to change its configuration at run-time, by creating or destroying architectural element instances and their links dynamically. The latter enables an architecture to change entirely its specification at run-time, by introducing new architectural element types and connections or by modifying the type and the running instances of its architectural elements. This paper presents an approach to address how to dynamically evolve the architectural types of a system from a platform-independent view. This approach identifies the different concerns involved in the adaptation process by encapsulating them into aspects, and makes use of reflection mechanisms to perform the type updating process. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: The incorporation of fault tolerance into systems normally increases their complexity, which consequently makes their analysis more difficult. This paper discusses how architectural abstractions can be effective in developing fault-tolerant software systems. Depending on the fault model and the resources available, different abstractions can be employed for representing issues that are related to fault tolerance, such as error detection, and error and fault handling. These architectural abstractions, and their internal views, can be instantiated into concrete components and connectors for designing fault-tolerant software architectures. Since structural and behavioural properties associated with these abstractions are formally specified, the process of verifying and validating software architectures can be automated. In this paper, we show how appropriate architectural abstractions and a recursive process can facilitate the architectural modelling and analysis of fault-tolerant software systems. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated in the context of a critical real-time application. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (20 refs)

Abstract: In domains, where great variability of requirements and products exists such as embedded system design domain, a product line (PL) approach is emerging as the most promising design paradigm. The key for the PL implementation is the use of domain analysis and domain modelling methods. We propose to represent domain variability using feature models enriched with lightweight domain ontology. We transform such models into generative component specifications using meta-programming techniques. We suggest: 1) to use domain analysis methods from two perspectives, software engineering and cognitive science; 2) to enrich domain variability models explicitly by contextualization and repurposing (i.e., by lightweight domain ontology); 3) to represent the model using the enriched feature diagrams (EFDs); 4) to encode EFDs using heterogeneous meta-programming. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Software architecture can be represented as a set of design decisions. Exploring and analyzing architectural design decisions are difficult due to how the decisions are represented and displayed. We describe four visualization aspects that apply to architectural design decision exploration and analysis: 1) tabular listing; 2) decision structure visualization; 3) decision chronology visualization; and 4) decision impact visualization. These aspects address some situations where visualization helps people understand and utilize decisions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (9 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the application of concepts from aspect-oriented software development to facilitate modular treatment of dynamic reconfiguration descriptions in specification-to-deployment environments. Our strategy differs from earlier work in the area by blending aspects and architecture abstractions simply and seamlessly through a special kind of connector -called an aspectual connector - that encapsulates reconfiguration interactions. More specifically, we propose an aspect-oriented specification-to-deployment environment, called AO-Plastik, that uses our AspectualAcme ADL to specify dynamic reconfiguration by means of aspectual connectors, and maps these specifications onto a reflective component runtime platform. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Empirical software engineering focuses on the evaluation of software engineering technologies, such as processes and tools, by comparing related sets of data. It has contributed a valuable body of knowledge in several areas such as software economics and software quality, which in turn drove important advances in related tools and techniques. Unfortunately this is not (yet) the case for software architecture, where empirical studies are still few. Such a condition demands for further empirical research efforts on the topic of software architecture and suggests specific areas of improvement. In this paper we discuss several essential, innovative, and maybe provocative, questions such as: Why do we have so few applications of empirical software engineering on software architecture? Which are the main difficulties? What can we do? (21 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture description languages allow software designers to focus on high level aspects of an application by abstracting from details. In general, a system’s architecture is specified in a hierarchical way. In fact, hierarchical components hide, at each level, the complexity of the sub-entities composing the system. As rewriting logic is a natural semantic framework for representing concurrency, parallelism, communication and interaction, it can be used for systems specification and verification. In this paper, we show how we can take advantage of hierarchical modeling of software systems specified with LfP, to prototype model checking process using Maude system. This approach allows us to hide and show, freely and easily, encapsulated details by moving between hierarchical levels. Thus, state explosion problem is mastered and reduced. In addition, system’s maintainability and error detection become easier and faster. (17 refs)

Abstract: When an application must evolve to cope with new context and user requirements, integrating new functionalities into its software architecture is necessary. The architect has thus to manually modify the architecture description, which is often tedious and error prone. In this paper, we propose FIESTA, a generic framework for automatically integrating new functionalities into an architecture description. Our approach is inspired by TranSAT, an integration framework. However, TranSAT is dedicated to a specific architecture description language (ADL) while our approach is ADL-independent. We have performed a domain analysis, studying for many ADLs how to integrate new functionalities. Based on this analysis, we have defined a generic ADL model to manipulate and reason about architectural elements that are involved in integration. Furthermore, we have developed a generic integration engine. (21 refs)

Abstract: Ageless software evolves, to meet new requirements, without reducing its efficiency or understandability. Here we introduce a methodology called informed evolution for supporting the construction and evolution of ageless software. This methodology integrates the software architecture (structure and constraints) and the system implementation (behaviour) within system execution. Evolution is effected by evolution patterns which are in turn guided by constraints specified in the software architecture. The availability of the software architecture and implementation at run-time ensures that changes are informed by design and implementation decisions, thus preserving efficiency and understandability. In this paper, we outline informed evolution, and describe how evolution patterns may be expressed for systems developed using this methodology. (5 refs)

Abstract: The past 20 years has seen significant investments in the theory and practice of software architecture. However, architectural deficiencies are frequently cited as a key factor in the shortcomings and failures that lead to unpredictable delivery of complex operational systems. Here, we consider the art and science of software architecture: we explore the current state of software architecture, identify key architectural trends and directions in academia and industry, and highlight some of the architectural research challenges which need to be addressed. The paper proposes an agenda of research activities to be carried out by a partnership between academia and industry. While challenges exist in many domains, for this paper we draw examples from one area of particular concern: safety-critical systems. (44 refs)

Abstract: Many issues must be taken into account in order to provide a right specification of the system-to-be to meet properly the established requirements. In this sense, the introduction of proper supporting techniques able to automate as much as possible the process means a clear advantage. In this work, we introduce a tool called MORPHEUS that gives support to our proposal by providing traceability throughout the process of generation of proto-architecture from requirements. (8 refs)

Abstract: Prototyping service oriented architectures based on Web services is a complex and time consuming process. Several steps, some of them complicated, are required for even the simplest application. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to create prototypes using more familiar constructs, entirely within a single programming language, and then define some of the components as Web services, and others as clients. We present a framework which enables programmers to create Web services and clients in ArchJava, an extension to Java which supports components and connectors as first class entities, by defining interfaces to services as ports on components. This supports rapid creation of prototypes by defining a component and connector structure of a Web service based system in ArchJava, and then later, with only minor modifications, change the prototype to use Web services. The services and client components will not be aware of this. Prom their point of view they are talking through connectors. Client components can also be connected to existing Web services.

Abstract: Web Services-based technologies have emerged as a technological alternative for computational web portals. Facilitating access to distributed resources through web interfaces while simultaneously ensuring security is one of the main goals in most of the currently existing manifold tools and frameworks. OpenCF, the Open Source Computational Framework that we have developed, shares these objectives and adds others, like enforced portability, genericity, modularity and compatibility with a wide range of High Performance Computing Systems. OpenCF has been implemented using lightweight technologies (Apache + PHP), resulting in a robust framework ready to run out of the box that is compatible with standard security requirements.

Abstract: Much of the complexity of software architecture design is derived from the inadequate modularization of key broadly-scoped concerns, such as exception handling, distribution, and persistence. However, conventional architecture metrics are not sensitive to the driving architectural concerns, thereby leading a number of false positives and false negatives in the design assessment process. Therefore, there is a need for assessment techniques that support a more effective identification of early design modularity anomalies relative to crosscutting concerns. In this context, this paper proposes a concern-driven measurement framework for assessing architecture modularity. It encompasses a mechanism for documenting architectural concerns, and a suite of concern-oriented architecture metrics. We evaluated the usefulness of the proposed framework while comparing the modularity of architecture design alternatives in three different case studies. (24 refs)

Abstract: The vast diversity of implementation and support platforms for service-oriented architectures (such as Web, Grid or even CORBA) increases the complexity of the development process of service-based systems. To reduce it, both the architectural properties of the SOC paradigm and a development approach based on the MDA proposal can be studied. This work describes a UML profile for the PIM-level service-oriented architectural modelling, as well as the correspondent metamodel. PIM (Platform Independent Model) level is chosen because it does not reflect constraints about any specific platform or implementation technology. The proposal sketched in this article is part of our research of a service-oriented development method (SOD-M) called MIDAS. (9 refs)

Abstract: Knowledge management plays an important role in the software architecting process. Recently, this role has become more apparent by a paradigm shift that views a software architecture as the set of architectural design decisions it embodies. This shift has sparked the discussion in both research and practice on how to best facilitate sharing of so-called architectural knowledge, and how tools can best be employed. In order to design successful tool support for architectural knowledge sharing it is important to take into account what software architecting really entails. To this end, in this paper we define the main characteristics of architecting, based on observations in a large software development organization, and state-of-the-art literature in software architecture. Based on the defined characteristics, we determine how best practices known from knowledge management could be used to improve architectural knowledge sharing. This results in the definition of a set of desired properties of architectural knowledge sharing tools. To improve the status quo of architectural knowledge sharing tools, we present the design of an architectural knowledge sharing platform. (39 refs)

Abstract: Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are a very promising research field since they find application in many different areas. Current proposals for WSN system development are mainly focused on implementation issues and they rarely rely on a Software Engineering methodology which supports their entire development life-cycle. The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach can contribute to solve this problem by allowing designers to model their systems at different abstraction levels, providing them with automatic model transformations to incrementally refine abstract models into more concrete ones. In this vein, this paper presents a MDE approach to WSN application development. Three levels of abstraction have been defined which allow designers to build: (1) domain-specific models, (2) component-based architecture descriptions, and (3) platform-specific models. Automatic model transformations between these three abstraction levels have been designed and, in order to demonstrate the viability of the proposal, a real WSN application has been developed using the implemented tools.

Abstract: In this paper, we report on the development of a methodology for the evolution of software towards new architectures. In our approach, we represent source code as graphs. This enables the use of graph transformation rules, allowing the automation of the transformation process. Prior to its model representation, the source code is subject to a preparatory step of semi-automatic code annotation according to the contribution of each of its parts in the target architecture. This paper first describes the overall methodology and then focuses on the code annotation and model transformation parts. We also discuss issues of the implementation of the approach based on existing tools. (14 refs)

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems are used in most of the industrial sectors to achieve production improvement, process optimization and time and cost reduction. Integration, reuse, flexibility and optimization are demanded to adapt to a rapidly changing and competitive market. There is also a growing requirement that all software tools that support the different phases of the development process (design, configuration, management) can be integrated as well. Thus, a consolidation of modeling methodologies for achieving this goal is needed. This paper proposes a Model-driven approach based on different views of the application for designing industrial control systems. XML schema and schematron technologies are selected for defining the domain languages and for checking their coherency and consistency. (7 refs)

Abstract: Currently, most software systems have a dynamic nature and evolve at run-time. The dynamic reconfiguration of software architectures has to be supported in order to enable their architectural element instances and their links to be created and destroyed at run-time. Complex components also need reconfiguration capabilities to evolve their internal compositions. This paper introduces an approach to support the dynamic reconfiguration of software architectures taking advantage of aspect-oriented techniques. It enables complex components to autonomously reconfigure themselves: they are capable of both having knowledge of their current configuration and reconfiguring themselves at run-time. This approach has been developed for the PRISMA aspect-oriented architectural model. A new kind of aspect has been created in PRISMA in order to provide dynamic reconfiguration services to each complex component; it is called the Configuration Aspect. (9 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture views represent the basic structures of a complex software system. By means of these views, it is possible to shape the different concerns that appear in the requirements and design phases. A modular view specifies the elements that must be built in the detailed design, and the relationships that must be established among them. This paper makes an analysis of the styles present in the modular view. This work establishes how these styles can be shaped and analyzed by means of their relations. (6 refs)

Abstract: We suppose a methodology and a middleware to build information systems that support mobile business processes. Our approach allows applications to make use of a self-mobilizing code paradigm, i.e. the ability of components to be distributed to devices depending on internal and external changes. The methodology is aimed at deriving architectural decisions from the business processes to be supported. We assess processes and their implications for mobility concerns and make use of architecture simulation to check feasibility and quality of service of such applications at design time and runtime.

Abstract: Recent advances in ubiquitous computing and artificial intelligence have led to a desire to better support user-oriented tasks by placing more intelligence in the computing infrastructure. This infrastructure helps mediate between computing resources and legacy applications on the one hand, and a user’s high-level goals on the other hand. In this talk I survey recent research in developing software architectures to support these new capabilities. Key features of these architectures are the ability to interface with legacy applications, but still add considerable support for user tasks; the ability to incorporate machine learning so that the system adapts to the user over time; and the ability to cope with resource variability and user mobility. I outline some of the consequent software engineering challenges that arise in this setting. (0 refs)

This style is based on the concept of aqueduct, a higher-order filter which comprises a sequence of filters able to define a process logic using flow control constructs. Those filters can be expanded, then defining an inner layer in the Aqueducts hierarchy. (8 refs)

Abstract: Architectural design has been characterized as making a series of decisions that have system-wide impact. These decisions have side effects which can have significant impact on the system. However, the impact may be first understood much later; when the system architecture is difficult to change. Architecture patterns can help architects understand the impact of the architectural decisions at the time these decisions are made, because patterns contain information about consequences and context of the pattern usage. However, this information has been of limited use because it is not presented consistently or systematically. We discuss the current limitations of patterns on evaluating their impact on quality attributes, and propose integrating the information of patterns’ impact on quality attributes in order to increase the usefulness of architecture patterns.

Abstract: The development of adaptive user interfaces has traditionally been restricted to research prototypes and few commercial products. Although there have been relevant achievements in the architectural support for self-adaptive context-aware systems [3,19], the notion of context commonly supported is restricted and does not explicitly contemplate the facets of context related to user-application interaction. Furthermore, applications need to comply with the proposed architectures, making the incorporation of adaptivity more difficult (or not possible at all) in the case of already existing applications. This work addresses key issues for the incorporation of self-adaptive behaviour in GUI-based applications, and proposes an aspect-based framework in order to overcome current limitations. (21 refs)

Abstract: This paper proposes a compositional formal approach to design correct publish/subscribe architecture styles. We provide a set of patterns and the corresponding composition rules to build architecture styles. The defined patterns and rules respect the principle of information propagation requiring that produced information have to reach all the subscribed consumers. We describe patterns as graphs and we use the Z notation to specify formally the semantic of each pattern and each rule. We prove consistency and correctness using the Z-Eves theorem prover. We show how to consider the interconnection topology between dispatchers as well as the subscription mechanism by simple refinements. We also show how to construct the Z specification of the designed architecture style based on applied rules. Moreover, we describe the dynamics of architecture via guarded graph-rewriting rules whose body describe the structural constraints and whose guards mainly describe the functional constraints of the system. We express these rules entirely with the Z notation also, obtaining a unified approach which handles both the static and the dynamic aspects. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (17 refs)

Abstract: The development of adaptive user interfaces has traditionally been restricted to research prototypes and few commercial products. Although there have been relevant achievements in the architectural support for self-adaptive context-aware systems [3,19], the notion of context commonly supported is restricted and does not explicitly contemplate the facets of context related to user-application interaction. Furthermore, applications need to comply with the proposed architectures, making the incorporation of adaptivity more difficult (or not possible at all) in the case of already existing applications. This work addresses key issues for the incorporation of self-adaptive behaviour in GUI-Based applications, and proposes an aspect-based framework in order to overcome current limitations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: Knowledge management plays an important role in the software architecting process. Recently, this role has become more apparent by a paradigm shift that views a software architecture as the set of architectural design decisions it embodies. This shift has sparked the discussion in both research and practice on how to best facilitate sharing of so-called architectural knowledge, and how tools can best be employed. In order to design successful tool support for architectural knowledge sharing it is important to take into account what software architecting really entails. To this end, in this paper we define the main characteristics of architecting, based on observations in a large software development organization, and state-of-the-art literature in software architecture. Based on the defined characteristics, we determine how best practices known from knowledge management could be used to improve architectural knowledge sharing. This results in the definition of a set of desired properties of architectural knowledge sharing tools. To improve the status quo of architectural knowledge sharing tools, we present the design of an architectural knowledge sharing platform. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (39 refs)

Abstract: Large scale software developments require substantial investment and are exposed to high level of risk. Architectural decisions taken at early stages of the development can substantially influence the entire level of technical risk. In this paper architectural decisions are divided into two basic groups: early - top level system organization decision establishing system organization patterns (the notion introduced in this paper) and detailed ones. However as it was shown on notable examples of large scale developments carried out in recent ten years in Poland, wrong decisions concerning system organization pattern can trigger severe risks that can lead to the development crisis. These risks are frequently connected with the complexity explosion syndrome - sudden, undetected growth of design complexity that exceeds the capabiblity of the development team and time budget. To manage these risks properly appropriate architecture analysis method has been introduced. On the contrary to the traditional scenario-based architecture analysis methods, like ATAM, it was based on GQM approach. A complete assessement framework have been defined comprising three goals: complexity control, organizational adequacy and satisfactory perforormance and reliability; a set of questions related to these goals, as well as metrics for the qualities expressed by these questions. The conclusion contains ex post analysis of exemplary large scale systems showing that the proposed framework provides adequate assessement of design risk. It has also been indicated that the critical risks identified during the evalution of the system organization pattern should be carefully managed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (23 refs)

Abstract: When an application must evolve to cope with new context and user requirements, integrating new functionalities into its software architecture is necessary. The architect has thus to manually modify the architecture description, which is often tedious and error prone. In this paper, we propose FIESTA, a generic framework for automatically integrating new functionalities into an architecture description. Our approach is inspired by TranSAT, an integration framework. However, TranSAT is dedicated to a specific architecture description language (ADL) while our approach is ADL-independent. We have performed a domain analysis, studying for many ADLs how to integrate new functionalities. Based on this analysis, we have defined a generic ADL model to manipulate and reason about architectural elements that are involved in integration. Furthermore, we have developed a generic integration engine. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (21 refs)

Abstract: Ageless Software evolves, to meet new requirements, without reducing its efficiency or understandability. Here we introduce a methodology called Informed Evolution for supporting the construction and evolution of ageless software. This methodology integrates the software architecture (structure and constraints) and the system implementation (behaviour) within system execution. Evolution is effected by evolution patterns which are in turn guided by constraints specified in the software architecture. The availability of the software architecture and implementation at run-time ensures that changes are informed by design and implementation decisions, thus preserving efficiency and understandability. In this paper, we outline Informed Evolution, and describe how evolution patterns may be expressed for systems developed using this methodology. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (5 refs)

Abstract: Empirical software engineering focuses on the evaluation of software engineering technologies, such as processes and tools, by comparing related sets of data. It has contributed a valuable body of knowledge in several areas such as Software Economics and Software Quality, which in turn drove important advances in related tools and techniques. Unfortunately this is not (yet) the case for software architecture, where empirical studies are still few. Such a condition demands for further empirical research efforts on the topic of software architecture and suggests specific areas of improvement. In this paper we discuss several essential, innovative, and maybe provocative, questions such as: Why do we have so few applications of empirical software engineering on software architecture? Which are the main difficulties? What can we do? © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (21 refs)

Abstract: Frameworks are an important form of reuse. However, they are often complex and hard to understand, what limits their success as a reuse option. To answer this problem, it has been widely recognized the need to effectively communicate frameworks and provide appropriate tool support, but difficulties still endure. We argue that the properties of frameworks are another aspect that is decisive for reuse problems and has not been sufficiently explored. We discuss these issues and we propose a framework architectural model that can be used to design frameworks that are easier to reuse. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (8 refs)

Abstract: Architectural design has been characterized as making a series of decisions that have system-wide impact. These decisions have side effects which can have significant impact on the system. However, the impact may be first understood much later; when the system architecture is difficult to change. Architecture patterns can help architects understand the impact of the architectural decisions at the time these decisions are made, because patterns contain information about consequences and context of the pattern usage. However, this information has been of limited use because it is not presented consistently or systematically. We discuss the current limitations of patterns on evaluating their impact on quality attributes, and propose integrating the information of patterns’ impact on quality attributes in order to increase the usefulness of architecture patterns. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: In this paper, we report on the development of a methodology for the evolution of software towards new architectures. In our approach, we represent source code as graphs. This enables the use of graph transformation rules, allowing the automation of the transformation process. Prior to its model representation, the source code is subject to a preparatory step of semi-automatic code annotation according to the contribution of each of its parts in the target architecture. This paper first describes the overall methodology and then focuses on the code annotation and model transformation parts. We also discuss issues of the implementation of the approach based on existing tools. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (14 refs)

Abstract: The conceptual modelling of software architectures is of central importance for the quality of a software system. A rich modelling language is required to integrate the different aspects of architecture modelling, such as architectural styles, structural and behavioural modelling, into a coherent framework. We propose an ontological approach for architectural style modelling based on description logic as an abstract, meta-level modelling instrument. Architectural styles are often neglected in software architectures. We introduce a framework for style definition and style combination. The link between quality requirements and conceptual modelling of architectural styles is investigated. The application of the ontological framework in the form of an integration into existing architectural description notations such as ACME and UML-based approaches, and also service ontologies is illustrated. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: AO-ADL is an aspect-oriented architecture description language where ‘crosscutting’ becomes a new kind of relationship between components. The semantic of connectors is extended in order to represent such crosscutting relationships. In this paper we focus on an important contribution of AO-ADL, its mechanism for defining aspect-oriented connector templates, which capture generic and reusable crosscutting influences, providing an aspect-oriented architectural pattern. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: Prototyping Service Oriented Architectures based on web services is a complex and time consuming process. Several steps, some of them complicated, are required for even the simplest application. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to create prototypes using more familiar constructs, entirely within a single programming language, and then define some of the components as web services, and others as clients. We present a framework which enables programmers to create web services and clients in ArchJava, an extension to Java which supports components and connectors as first class entities, by defining interfaces to services as ports on components. This supports rapid creation of prototypes by defining a component and connector structure of a web service based system in ArchJava, and then later, with only minor modifications, change the prototype to use web services. The services and client components will not be aware of this. From their point of view they are talking through connectors. Client components can also be connected to existing web services. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (15 refs)

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems are used in most of the industrial sectors to achieve production improvement, process optimization and time and cost reduction. Integration, reuse, flexibility and optimization are demanded to adapt to a rapidly changing and competitive market. There is also a growing requirement that all software tools that support the different phases of the development process (design, configuration, management) can be integrated as well. Thus, a consolidation of modeling methodologies for achieving this goal is needed. This paper proposes a Model-driven approach based on different views of the application for designing industrial control systems. XML schema and schematron technologies are selected for defining the domain languages and for checking their coherency and consistency. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (7 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture description languages allow software designers to focus on high level aspects of an application by abstracting from details. In general, a system’s architecture is specified in a hierarchical way. In fact, hierarchical components hide, at each level, the complexity of the sub-entities composing the system. As rewriting logic is a natural semantic framework for representing concurrency, parallelism, communication and interaction, it can be used for systems specification and verification. In this paper, we show how we can take advantage of hierarchical modeling of software systems specified with LfP, to proto-type model checking process using Maude system. This approach allows us to hide and show, freely and easily, encapsulated details by moving between hierarchical levels. Thus, state explosion problem is mastered and reduced. In addition, system’s maintainability and error detection become easier and faster. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (17 refs)

Abstract: Recent advances in ubiquitous computing and artificial intelligence have led to a desire to better support user-oriented tasks by placing more intelligence in the computing infrastructure. This infrastructure helps mediate between computing resources and legacy applications on the one hand, and a user’s high-level goals on the other hand. In this talk I survey recent research in developing software architectures to support these new capabilities. Key features of these architectures are the ability to interface with legacy applications, but still add considerable support for user tasks; the ability to incorporate machine learning so that the system adapts to the user over time; and the ability to cope with resource variability and user mobility. I outline some of the consequent software engineering challenges that arise in this setting. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: We suppose a methodology and a middleware to build information systems that support mobile business processes. Our approach allows applications to make use of a self-mobilizing code paradigm, i.e. the ability of components to be distributed to devices depending on internal and external changes. The methodology is aimed at deriving architectural decisions from the business processes to be supported. We assess processes and their implications for mobility concerns and make use of architecture simulation to check feasibility and quality of service of such applications at design time and runtime. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: When increasing the complexity of software systems new techniques allowing for their adequate manipulation are required. In the last ten years, AOSD has been proposed to manage the systems complexity by considering concepts of AO programming extended along the software life cycle. The suitability of the existence of an AO architectural design appears when AO concepts are extended to the whole life cycle. In order to adequately specify the AO design, Aspect-Oriented ADLs are needed. In this paper AspectLEDA, an ADL to support architectural descriptions treating aspects, is presented. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (4 refs)

Abstract: Many organizations have to carry out their work by groups of people who are geographically distributed. The groups can experiment changes, which demand the development of applications supporting groupwork and allowing the adaptation to different groupwork organization styles and to both individual and collective needs. This paper proposes a SOA-based architecture that provides the suitable structure for the development of collaborative applications that are both adaptive and adaptable. We also present an adaptation process that allows the applications based on the architecture to be adapted to the changes in the groupwork organization and to the necessity of new functionalities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: There is a recognized gap between requirements and architectures. There is also evidence that architecture evaluation, when done at the early phases of the development lifecycle, is an effective way to ensure the quality attributes of the final system. As quality attributes may be satisfied at a different extent by different alternative architectural solutions, an exploration and evaluation of alternatives is often needed. In order to address this issue at the requirements level, we propose to model architectures using the i* framework, a goal-oriented modelling language that allows to represent the functional and non-functional requirements of an architecture using actors and dependencies instead of components and connectors. Once the architectures are modelled, we propose guidelines for the generation of alternative architectures based upon existing architectural patterns, and for the definition of structural metrics for the evaluation of the resulting alternative models. The applicability of the approach is shown with the Home Service Robot case study. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (28 refs)

Abstract: The past 20 years has seen significant investments in the theory and practice of software architecture. However, architectural deficiencies are frequently cited as a key factor in the shortcomings and failures that lead to unpredictable delivery of complex operational systems. Here, we consider the art and science of software architecture: we explore the current state of software architecture, identify key architectural trends and directions in academia and industry, and highlight some of the architectural research challenges which need to be addressed. The paper proposes an agenda of research activities to be carried out by a partnership between academia and industry. While challenges exist in many domains, for this paper we draw examples from one area of particular concern: safety-critical systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (44 refs)

Abstract: Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are a very promising research field since they find application in many different areas. Current proposals for WSN system development are mainly focused on implementation issues and they rarely rely on a Software Engineering methodology which supports their entire development life-cycle. The Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach can contribute to solve this problem by allowing designers to model their systems at different abstraction levels, providing them with automatic model transformations to incrementally refine abstract models into more concrete ones. In this vein, this paper presents a MDE approach to WSN application development. Three levels of abstraction have been defined which allow designers to build: (1) domain-specific models, (2) component-based architecture descriptions, and (3) platform-specific models. Automatic model transformations between these three abstraction levels have been designed and, in order to demonstrate the viability of the proposal, a real WSN application has been developed using the implemented tools. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

As services come in many flavors and guises they have differing characteristics. In this paper we describe the most necessary aspects and features of automated services. We also focus on the interplay of SOAs and Business Process Management technologies and argue that the key enablers for Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) should focus on four inter-related elements: engineering and planning the SOA, SOA implementation, SOA management and monitoring and SOA governance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: The term co-evolution describes the symbiotic relationship between dynamically changing business environments and the software that supports them. Business changes create pressures on the software to evolve, and at the same time technology changes create pressures on the business to evolve. More generally, we are concerned with systems where it is neither economically nor technologically feasible to suspend the operation of the system while it is being evolved. Typically these are long-lived systems in which dynamic co-evolution, whereby a system evolves as part of its own execution in reaction to both predicted and emergent events, is the only feasible option for change. Examples of such systems include continuously running business process models, sensor nets, grid applications, self-adapting/tuning systems, routing systems, control systems, autonomic systems, and pervasive computing applications. Active architectures address both the structural and behavioural requirements of dynamic co-evolving software by modelling software architecture as part of the on-going computation, thereby allowing evolution during execution and formal checking that desired system properties are preserved through evolution. This invited paper presents results on active architectures from the Compliant System Architecture and ArchWare projects. We have designed and constructed the ArchWare-ADL, a formal, well-founded architecture description language, based on the higher-order typed p-calculus, which consists of a set of layers to address the requirements of active architectures. The ArchWare-ADL design principles, concepts and formal notations are presented together with its sophisticated reflective technologies for supporting active architectures and thereby dynamic co-evolution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: Software architecture views represent the basic structures of a complex software system. By means of these views, it is possible to shape the different concerns that appear in the requirements and design phases. A modular view specifies the elements that must be built in the detailed design, and the relationships that must be established among them. This paper makes an analysis of the styles present in the modular view. This work establishes how these styles can be shaped and analyzed by means of their relations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (6 refs)

Abstract: Currently, most software systems have a dynamic nature and evolve at run-time. The dynamic reconfiguration of software architectures has to be supported in order to enable their architectural element instances and their links to be created and destroyed at run-time. Complex components also need reconfiguration capabilities to evolve their internal compositions. This paper introduces an approach to support the dynamic reconfiguration of software architectures taking advantage of aspect-oriented techniques. It enables complex components to autonomously reconfigure themselves: they are capable of both having knowledge of their current configuration and reconfiguring themselves at run-time. This approach has been developed for the PRISMA aspect-oriented architectural model. A new kind of aspect has been created in PRISMA in order to provide dynamic reconfiguration services to each complex component; it is called the Configuration Aspect. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

Abstract: We propose a pattern-based software development method comprising analysis (using problem frames) and design (using architectural and design patterns), of which especially evolving systems benefit. Evolution operators guide a pattern-based transformation procedure, including re-engineering tasks for adjusting a given software architecture to meet new system demands. Through application of these operators, relations between analysis and design documents are explored systematically for accomplishing desired software modifications. This allows for reusing development documents to a large extent, even when the application environment and the requirements change. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (15 refs)

Abstract: The vast diversity of implementation and support platforms for service-oriented architectures (such as Web, Grid or even CORBA) increases the complexity of the development process of service-based systems. To reduce it, both the architectural properties of the SOC paradigm and a development approach based on the MDA proposal can be studied. This work describes a UML profile for the PIM-level service-oriented architectural modelling, as well as the correspondent metamodel. PIM (Platform Independent Model) level is chosen because it does not reflect constraints about any specific platform or implementation technology. The proposal sketched in this article is part of our research of a service-oriented development method (SOD-M) called MIDAS. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007. (9 refs)

Abstract: The Bay of Seine is a potentially important nursery ground, especially for flatfish. This area, however, is also strongly anthropogenically influenced. A composite approach was chosen to compare the flatfish nursery function of the Seine estuary with other coastal and estuarine areas and to determine the impact of anthropogenic disturbances. It emerges that alteration of the nursery function in the Seine estuary is related to the loss of nursery habitat and to a lower quality of the residual surfaces. These observations stressed the importance of habitat destruction and decreased quality of remaining habitat for fish stocks renewal. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (39 refs)

Abstract: Industry represents about 31% of the upper Normandy region total value-added against 19.5% at national level. The same holds for the employment, since industry accounts for 21% of total local jobs, against 18% at national level. This article attempts to answer the following question: can we explain this specific concentration of economic activity by the natural advantages (water availability, easy access by water) provided by the Seine Estuary? We first characterize “strongly Seine Estuary-dependent” industrial sectors, using simple indicators such as water withdrawals and pollution emissions. Then, we evaluate the influence of these sectors on the forces (labor market pooling, input sharing and knowledge spillovers) that lead to concentration of the economic activity in the Seine estuary. We find strong evidence that this economic activity is still natural resource based. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (15 refs)

Abstract: The mouth of the Seine River estuary (France) has undergone marked morphological evolution over several decades mainly due to engineering works aimed at improving access to Rouen and Le Havre harbours. The intertidal areas are decreasing in size and the lower estuary is accumulating sediment and prograding. In order to understand and better describe the major morphological behaviours of the estuary, a morphodynamic numerical model was developed within the Seine-Aval program. At the end of the 1st part of the research program, a validated fine sediment transport model (3D) was available (Le Hir et al., 2001b). As the present morphological study addresses medium-term issues (a few decades), and because of the need to investigate impacts of local structures or events, we chose to use the so-called “process-based approach” starting from the existing model. First, the existing model was upgraded to account for (suspended) sand transport, and to achieve coupling between morphological changes and sediment transport. Erodability of the sediment accounts for the respective proportions of mud and sand. Simulations starting from an arbitrary surficial sediment cover show that the model is able to reproduce realistic sediment patterns. For example, it is able to change the sediment nature on the intertidal flat near Le Havre from sand to mud. Observed structures of suspended sediment are also reproduced: fine particles mainly follow the turbidity maximum whereas significant concentrations of sand grains in suspension are found where the hydrodynamic stresses are intense. Concerning morphodynamics, simulations with real forcing over one year are discussed. The effect of waves on the bathymetric evolution of the mouth is shown and the sensitivity of morphodynamics to the coupling procedure is tested. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Estuarine areas are sites of human pressures and degradation. In order to maintain and/or restore the quality of estuarine ecosystems, it is necessary to describe their structure and functioning. For that reason, many recent scientific works focus on food webs, which are depicted as being good indicators of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Hence it is necessary to question how estuarine food webs can be described. This paper proposes a pragmatic and practical review of the most widely used techniques (stomach/gut content analysis, stable isotope ratios and biochemical markers) with emphasis on their main advantages, drawbacks and bias according to possible ecological goals (ecological quality objectives). These approaches, although quite different, provide complementary information about the trophic relationships in the system, that is to say the sources of organic matter and the description of energy flows between the different compartments of the food web. In trophic models, all these results can be integrated to a global picture of the estuarine trophic structure. This is considered to be an essential step towards the understanding of the functioning of these ecosystems. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (109 refs)

Abstract: An intertidal salt marsh fish assemblage inhabiting two creeks on North Bull Island, Dublin Bay was sampled monthly from June 2000 until May 2002. Water temperature and salinity were recorded in situ and samples were also taken for Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Chlorophyll a. All fish caught were weighed and measured and classified into functional guilds. A total of 6,549 individuals comprising 10 fish species from 10 families were recorded within the two creeks. The community was dominated by a few species, a feature common to other estuarine fish populations. Of the 10 species found, the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps, the 3-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, the thick-lipped grey mullet, Chelon labrosus and the flounder, Platichthys flesus contributed 98.4% of all fish sampled. The fish population of the channels at Bull Island, Dublin, was dominated by the resident gobies (true estuarine resident species), but also hosted juveniles of species such as the bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (marine juvenile migrant species). In turn, the nekton populations were dominated by the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon and the fairy shrimp, Palaemonetes varians especially in winter when fewer fish (numbers of species and abundance) were found. Multivariate analysis of fish diversity and abundance revealed a strong seasonal pattern but there was little evidence of difference between creeks, nor of tidal (spring/neap) effects. The estuarine fish using the intertidal marsh creeks have been little studied in Europe yet they play a major role with the decapods in these habitats. This role needs to be quantified for a proper understanding of the system’s function. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (52 refs)

Abstract: During the 2001-2002 hydrological cycle, 8,000 tons P year-1 (44% as particulate phosphorus) originating from the Seine basin entered the Seine estuary. P content in suspended sediments (SS) is 2.9 g P kg-1 (80% as inorganic form) at Poses (the upstream limit of the Seine estuary). During the transfer from Poses to Caudebec (the limit of saline water intrusion), Particulate Inorganic Phosphorus (PIP) in SS decreases by 40% whereas Particulate Organic Phosphorus (POP) remains stable. This decrease is explained as the result of (i) a dilution by SS poorer in P, originating from storage zones (mudflats) within the estuary, and (ii) a loss of P by sedimentation, especially in the Rouen harbour where 15% to 20% of SS are yearly trapped and extracted. Downstream, in the turbidity maximum of the estuary, P content in SS is twice as low as at Poses (1.5 g P kg-1, 70% as inorganic form). PIP content is fairly homogeneous both vertically and throughout an annual survey. On the other hand, POP varies by season. Higher POP content is observed during vernal period with phytoplankton accumulation. In a salinity gradient from 0 to 30 (PSS78), PIP content further decreases by 30%. POP does not vary much in this gradient, leading to the assumption that PIP is submitted to desorption in response to the dilution by marine waters (poor in orthophosphates). Using 32P isotopic method, we establish a mathematical formulation of P exchangeable between the suspended solid and water phases of the Seine estuary. Particulate P in the turbidity maximum zone is shown to represent a possible source of dissolved P, available for algal growth in the Seine Bight. Instead of playing a role of nutrient retention, the turbidity maximum zone of the Seine estuary could favour coastal eutrophication. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. (62 refs)

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of fine sediment transport across the upper intertidal zone is critical in managing the erosion and accretion of intertidal areas, and in managed realignment/estuarine habitat recreation strategies. This paper examines the transfer of sediments between salt marsh and mudflat environments in two contrasting macrotidal estuaries: the Seine (France) and the Medway (UK), using data collected during two joint field seasons undertaken by the Anglo-French RIMEW project (Rives-Manche Estuary Watch). High-resolution ADCP, Altimeter, OBS and ASM measurements from mudflat and marsh surface environments have been combined with sediment trap data to examine short-term sediment transport processes under spring tide and storm flow conditions. In addition, the longer-term accumulation of sediment in each salt marsh system has been examined via radiometric dating of sediment cores. In the Seine, rapid sediment accumulation and expansion of salt marsh areas, and subsequent loss of open intertidal mudflats, is a major problem, and the data collected here indicate a distinct net landward flux of sediments into the marsh interior. Suspended sediment fluxes are much higher than in the Medway estuary (averaging 0.09 g/m3/s), and vertical accumulation rates at the salt marsh/mudflat boundary exceed 3 cm/y. Suspended sediment data collected during storm surge conditions indicate that significant in-wash of fine sediments into the marsh interior can occur during (and following) these high-magnitude events. In contrast to the Seine, the Medway is undergoing erosion and general loss of salt marsh areas. Suspended sediment fluxes are of the order of 0.03 g/m 3/s, and the marsh system here has much lower rates of vertical accretion (sediment accumulation rates are ca. 4 mm/y). Current velocity data for the Medway site indicate higher velocities on the ebb tide than occur on the flood tide, which may be sufficient to remobilise sediments deposited on the previous tide and so force net removal of material from the marsh. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: The Seine estuary (France) is currently one of the world’s most contaminated estuaries, due in particular to its high cadmium and lead content. Proper understanding of contaminant transfer, transformation and retention mechanisms throughout the estuary and up to the adjacent marine zone require a range of studies involving data collections, experiments, and modeling tool. A multivariable transport model (SiAM-3D) was used to simulate dissolved and particulate transport and it is applied to several calculation grids; a speciation model (MOCO) was used to select key species and obtain a schematic system representation. The coupled model for Cd and Pb was compared with field measurements. The complementary character of various tools (model applied to annual time scale, in situ measurements and experiments) allowed to explore and quantify various hypotheses on the high dissolved cadmium concentrations observed during low river flow. The target is to achieve a compromise between acceptable computing times and adequate result accuracy. Although particle and contaminant behaviour is globally well-reproduced by the coarse grid, calculation errors relating to bayward fluxes and stocks deposited inside the estuary were highlighted after comparison with the fine grid. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Energy (biomass) and energy flows (production, inputs, transfers and losses) were calculated for eight and twelve compartment systems (phytoplankton, benthic primary producers (macroalgae, microphytobenthos), zooplankton, benthos (meiofauna, suspensivores, deposivores and predators), fish, birds and particulate organic matter (POM) in sediment and suspended particulate matter (SPM)) both balanced and unbalanced of Dublin Bay and the Baie de Somme. The resultant models were analysed with the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) network analysis package. While the two systems share many properties such as the dominant biosedimentary facies, there are fundamental differences in both structuring and responses of the systems. The network analysis suggested that the Baie de Somme was far more productive, notably in terms of water column productivity, and was the more mature system. The high organic SPM input to Dublin Bay greatly elevated the degree of detritivory such that the analysis generated metrics indicative of a mature system but which rather reflected the degree of anthropogenic stress on the system. However, the analysis of both systems displayed varying degrees of maturity. Increasing the number of compartments greatly increased the calculated throughput (T) of the system and other associated metrics such as capacity (C), ascendancy (A) and redundancy (R). In the case of Dublin Bay, a higher number of compartments increased the various measures of system maturity, but this was much less marked for the Baie de Somme. Balancing the systems also increased T, C, A and R, and, to a lesser extent but not invariably, the system maturity metrics. The ratios of the comparative system metrics such as comparative ascendancy (A/C) were much less changed by the different methodologies and as such are recommended as robust measures for intercomparison of system performance. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Temporal and spatial variability of the Abra alba-Pectinaria koreni and Macoma balthica communities was examined in the northern part of the Seine estuary (North Channel) over different space and time scales in order to assess the role that the hydrologic regime and/or anthropogenic influences play in defining benthic communities over time. Sediment in the North Channel displayed strong spatial and temporal variability, sustained by intense sediment transport episodes. Total macrobenthic abundances ranged widely on the course of the year and there was no evidence of a seasonal signal for the density fluctuations, whatever the spatial scale considered. The bio-sedimentary dynamics can be divided into two periods: the first corresponds to the high flow rate period (January-May) during which fauna is influenced by fine silt/clay deposition, and the second to the low flow rate period (June-December) during which sandy deposits prevail. Despite the absence of significant correlations between sediment composition and abundance, episodes of sediment transport seem to be an important structuring mechanism in the Seine estuary. As a consequence, the faunal composition varied throughout the year. The winter and spring fauna, characterised by species living on muddy fine-sands or muds, were enriched during the summer and autumn by species living in clean fine sand, such as Donax vittatus, Nephtys cirrosa or Spio decoratus, mainly represented by adult individuals. Secondary settlement of drifters may explain the rapid structuration of assemblages a few days after the sandy deposits. Our results suggest the importance of the bentho-pelagic coupling, primarily induced by the sedimentary instability, on the macrobenthic fauna dynamics. The intra-annual variability of assemblages at the mouth of the Seine river and the silted situation of the North Channel might simply be the result of the silting up and alteration of the inner estuary, generated by several decades of man-made modifications and natural processes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: A study of the particulate organic carbon (POC) in the estuarine turbidity maxima (ETMs) of the three major French macrotidal estuaries shows that the average contents are 1.5, 3.3 and 3.1% (expressed in % of dry suspended sediment) in the Gironde, Loire and Seine Estuaries, respectively. There is no seasonal variation of POC contents in the Gironde Estuary, whereas, they often increase in the Loire and the Seine Estuaries in spring and summer. The lability of the estuarine particulate organic matter was estimated by two analyses: 1/labile organic matter was measured as the organic carbon loss during incubation tests over one month; 2/ the hydrolysable organic fraction was determined after 6N HCl digestion. The organic fractions of the ETMs are mainly refractory. Any increase in the amount of POC as compared to the background levels (cited above) is always correlated to an increase of organic matter lability. The yearly average fluvial contributions by various particulate organic pools (soil and litter organic matter; organic matter of phytoplanktonic and human origin) that enter the three estuaries were quantified. In the Garonne River, soil and litter are the major (90%) POC sources. In the Loire system, due to the eutrophication of the river water, phytoplankton contributes up to 50% of the total POC load. In the Seine river, soil and litter contribute 70% of the total POC input; POC of human origin is also significant (10%), due to the impact of the City of Paris (10 million inhabitants). The lability of the different types of organic matter ranks as follows: phytoplankton ~litter > human-origin organic matter >> soil. By combining the POC budgets and the lability of each type of organic fraction, it was possible to explain why the POC of the three ETMs is different and characterizes its refractory vs. labile nature. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Measurements of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were carried out from 2001 to 2003 in various environmental compartments (ambient air, atmospheric deposition, soils, sediments, runoff, and surface waters) in the Seine Estuary. The goal of this study was to identify the importance of atmospheric fluxes to occurrence of PAHs in the estuary, and to estimate the major pathways of their transport and accumulation within this ecosystem. The annual atmospheric inputs in the estuary ranged from 2.5 to 16 kg for the first sampling year, which is high when compared to those calculated for other European locations. In parallel, PAH transport from the atmosphere to the watershed outlet was investigated for two rural and urban small experimental watersheds within the Seine Estuary. In rural areas, atmospheric inputs are higher than exported loads by surface water and PAHs are accumulating in soils. The inverse occurs in urban areas, where the contribution of atmospheric deposition is negligible compared with PAH exported loads by runoff. These results allowed us to establish a mass balance for PAHs on the scale of the Seine Estuary, and to determine the dynamics of PAH transport. This study highlights the role of the atmospheric compartment in the transfer of contaminants and the importance of the local PAH inputs within the Seine Estuary. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Mollusc and polychaete distribution in the mud flats along the Dese estuary (lagoon of Venice, Italy) was analysed in May, August and October to evaluate taxonomic biodiversity and zonation pattern of soft macrobenthos in an area of the lagoon hardly known from this point of view. Throughout the studied area most of the species were polychaetes, particularly Streblospio shrubsolii (Buchanan), which showed greater abundance from May to October. Molluscs and polychaetes showed a zonation of marine species which colonize brackish environments in the outer and intermediate areas of the estuary and of brackish water species in the inner one. In the outer area different assemblages were attributed to different sediment types. This distribution pattern, put in relation to the distance from the sea, was evident in May and partly blurred in August and October: the assemblages of the inner area of the estuary invaded the intermediated area in August and affected outer area in October because of spreading of the brackish water species S. shrubsolii, which became dominant. The distribution pattern of molluscs and polychaetes can be explained in terms of confinement as the leading factor influencing water quality and dynamics of the ecosystem. It is also needed to be taken into consideration the role played by competition due to different degree of opportunism of the most abundant species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Results of nitrate and phosphate concentrations measured using hand-held ‘Hach’ monitors are presented, both over individual tidal cycles and over longer term deployments at Pagham Harbour, West Sussex, UK. This macrotidal lagoon (offshore tidal range 3.0 m neaps-6.5 m springs) is a site of key importance as a nature reserve and a home for several rare species of plants and animals. In particular, the effects of fresh water-salt water stratification over 4 tidal cycles at two tidal-fresh water boundaries is presented. It is shown that obtaining periodic vertical profile measurements during individual tidal cycles helps to quantify the transport mechanisms of nutrients from the tidal limits into the main body of the lagoon. Of key interest is the interaction between sediment-bound nutrients with the surrounding water in which the sediment is suspended during parts of the tidal cycle. Synthesis of these results with existing knowledge about sediment-water-nutrient interactions reveals how it is possible for nutrients to become trapped at the muddy tidal limits of the lagoon. In certain cases it is shown that nutrient-rich water from fresh water streams only gradually mixes with the denser, salt water of the incoming tide. Whilst a degree of salinity-induced stratification may be expected during the flood tide, these observations suggest that the water column is stratified with respect to both N and P, even well into the ebb tide. Thus at sites where stratification is important, there is a tendency for nutrients to remain preferentially near the water surface, and thus come into contact with fine, less mobile sediments near the surface of inter-tidal zones, which are themselves, in general, accreting. Since the overlying water is generally slow-moving during high water, it is postulated that saline-induced vertical stratification of estuarine water is an important mechanism in promoting nutrient build-up in muddy inter-tidal areas of this kind. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Because of their widespread geographical distribution and high capacity of bioaccumulation, bivalve species, in particular blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), are considered as sentinel organisms in Ecotoxicology for monitoring the effects of xenobiotics in estuaries and coastal areas. The purpose of this study was to identify molecular biomarkers for atrazine exposure by using differential analysis of gene expression. For this, the digestive gland transcriptome of atrazine exposed mussels (1 µg l-1, 24 h) was compared to that of control animals. Candidate transcripts for differential expression were isolated by Subtractive PCR Suppressive Hybridization (SSH). A total of 543 potentially regulated clones was isolated. A part of these clones was sequenced and extensive similarity searches in genome data bases were carried out. Among the sequenced cDNA clones, gld15, gld122 and gld177 which corresponded to potentially down regulated mRNA, were likely to encode for a Mytilus edulis DnaK-type molecular chaperone of the Heat shock 70 protein family. As a matter of fact, the deduced peptide sequence of gld15 comprised 223 amino acids and possessed 87.4% of identity with the human Hsc70. Heat shock proteins and, in particular Hsc70 and Hsp70, are considered as molecular chaperones involved in various cellular processes including refolding of damaged proteins and apoptosis. The fact that atrazine potentially down regulates the expression of a cytoprotective gene was unexpected and further experiments are required to measure the kinetics and dose response effects of atrazine on DnaK gene expression. Differential gene expression analysis is one of most widely used approach of the postgenomics era in the biomedical field of research and it may prove to be a valuable tool for the identification of new and relevant biomarkers in Ecotoxicology. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Abstract: Pt/C electrocatalysts, aimed at maximizing the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and consequently the specific mass activity of fuel cell reactions, are obtained by firstly depositing Pt nanoparticles on colloidal silica (Pt-silica), followed by the adsorption of the latter onto a carbon support. This method of catalyst preparation increases Pt metal utilization and generates accessible void space in the interpenetrating particle network of carbon and silica for the facile transport of reactants and products. Both electrochemical hydrogen adsorption/desorption and CO oxidation measurements show an increase in the ECSA using this approach. Methanol electrooxidation is used as a test reaction to evaluate the catalytic activity. It is found that the silica modified catalyst is three times as active as a catalyst prepared without silica, under otherwise identical conditions. (22 refs)

Abstract: Pt/C electrocatalysts, aimed at maximizing the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and consequently the specific mass activity of fuel cell reactions, are obtained by firstly depositing Pt nanoparticles on colloidal silica (Pt-silica), followed by the adsorption of the latter onto a carbon support. This method of catalyst preparation increases Pt metal utilization and generates accessible void space in the interpenetrating particle network of carbon and silica for the facile transport of reactants and products. Both electrochemical hydrogen adsorption/desorption and CO oxidation measurements show an increase in the ECSA using this approach. Methanol electrooxidation is used as a test reaction to evaluate the catalytic activity. It is found that the silica modified catalyst is three times as active as a catalyst prepared without silica, under otherwise identical conditions. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. (22 refs)

Abstract: Effect of upper and lower potential limits on R stability in potential cycling experiments is studied for 20 wt. % R/C E-TEK catalyst in acidic medium. The R electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss is observed as a parameter to study different potential ranges. It is observed that at upper potential limits the ECSA loss is influenced by electrochemical R dissolution while at lower potential limits reduction of ß oxide phase plays important role in ECSA loss. ©The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: A discharge test was conducted to evaluate the degradation of the performance of electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses show that after the test, the mean particle size of the anode electrocatalyst did not change, while that of the cathode electrocatalyst increased remarkably. The main reason for the sintering of electrocatalysts is the existence of liquids. Amorphous Ru species in the anode catalyst inhibit the growing of Pt crystallites. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) decreased after the discharge test, with a degree higher than the specific surface area(SSA), both for the anode and the cathode. Part of ruthenium was lost from the anode electrocatalyst during the discharge test. (16 refs)

Abstract: It is inherently allowed that a user engages in more than one activity at the same time. The interweave of multiple activities makes an activity have more than two states, i.e. the paused state in addition to active and inactive states and move from one state to another. In this paper, we propose an activity lifecycle management scheme that enables a system to adapt the services which help a user to do an activity to the state transitions of the activity. The proposed scheme detects the interruption between activities in terms of perceivable effects of their associated services. The state transitions of an activity driven by the interruption are handled by Event-Condition-State-Action (ECSA) policy, which is extended from ECA policy. It specifies how the services should be adapted to the interruption degree - how much the interrupting activity interferes the current activity as well as the state transition of an activity.

Abstract: Pt nanoparticles (2-3 nm) supported on carbon black (C), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) are prepared by an ethylene glycol reduction method. The catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the durability of the catalysts are evaluated under condition simulating the environment of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs). The Pt electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt/DWNT and Pt/MWNT degrade 32% after accelerated durability test (ADT), compared with 38% for Pt/SWNT and 48% for Pt/C. The degradation rate of Pt/C is about 1.5 times higher than that of Pt/DWNT. The typical ORR polarization curves of Pt/C, Pt/SWNT, Pt/DWNT and Pt/MWNT obtained before and after ADT are also examined. Before ADT, Pt/DWNT shows the highest catalytic activity towards ORR, followed by Pt/MWNT, Pt/C, and Pt/SWNT in that order. After ADT, the sequence of ORR activity of Pt/C and Pt/SWNT has changed and the overall order is: Pt/DWNT > Pt/MWNT > Pt/SWNT > Pt/C. The Pt/DWNT catalyst shows the highest catalytic activity and the best durability for ORR among the C and CNT supported Pt catalysts. © The Electrochemical Society. (34 refs)

Abstract: Many organizations have to carry out their work by groups of people who are geographically distributed. The groups can experiment changes, which demand the development of applications supporting groupwork and allowing the adaptation to different groupwork organization styles and to both individual and collective needs. This paper proposes a SOA-based architecture that provides the suitable structure for the development of collaborative applications that are both adaptive and adaptable. We also present an adaptation process that allows the applications based on the architecture to be adapted to the changes in the groupwork organization and to the necessity of new functionalities.

Abstract: Large scale software developments require substantial investment and are exposed to high level of risk. Architectural decisions taken at early stages of the development can substantially influence the entire level of technical risk. In this paper architectural decisions are divided into two basic groups: early - top level system organization decision establishing system organization patterns (the notion introduced in this paper) and detailed ones. However as it was shown on notable examples of large scale developments carried out in recent ten years in Poland, wrong decisions concerning system organization pattern can trigger severe risks that can lead to the development crisis. These risks are frequently connected with the complexity explosion syndrome - sudden, undetected growth of design complexity that exceeds the capabiblity of the development team and time budget. To manage these risks properly appropriate architecture analysis method has been introduced. On the contrary to the traditional scenario-based architecture analysis methods, like ATAM, it was based on GQM approach. A complete assessement framework have been defined comprising three goals: complexity control, organizational adequacy and satisfactory perforormance and reliability; a set of questions related to these goals, as well as metrics for the qualities expressed by these questions. The conclusion contains ex post analysis of exemplary large scale systems showing that the proposed framework provides adequate assessement of design risk. It has also been indicated that the critical risks identified during the evalution of the system organization pattern should be carefully managed. (23 refs)

Using abstract components allow us to define very different architectures in a platform independent way. The translation of the abstract components to platform specific code is a hard and difficult task that can be partially automated with the help of the model transformation tools provided by the MDE approach.

Abstract: When increasing the complexity of software systems new techniques allowing for their adequate manipulation are required. In the last ten years, AOSD has been proposed to manage the systems complexity by considering concepts of AO programming extended along the software life cycle. The suitability of the existence of an AO architectural design appears when AO concepts are extended to the whole life cycle. In order to adequately specify the AO design, Aspect-Oriented ADLs are needed. In this paper AspectLEDA, an ADL to support architectural descriptions treating aspects, is presented. (4 refs)

Abstract: We propose a pattern-based software development method comprising analysis (using problem frames) and design (using architectural and design patterns), of which especially evolving systems benefit. Evolution operators guide a pattern-based transformation procedure, including re-engineering tasks for adjusting a given software architecture to meet new system demands. Through application of these operators, relations between analysis and design documents are explored systematically for accomplishing desired software modifications. This allows for reusing development documents to a large extent, even when the application environment and the requirements change. (15 refs)

The semantic of connectors is extended in order to represent such crosscutting relationships. In this paper we focus on an important contribution of AO-ADL, its mechanism for defining aspect-oriented connector templates, which capture generic and reusable crosscutting influences, providing an aspect-oriented architectural pattern.

Abstract: The conceptual modelling of software architectures is of central importance for the quality of a software system. A rich modelling language is required to integrate the different aspects of architecture modelling, such as architectural styles, structural and behavioural modelling, into a coherent framework. We propose an ontological approach for architectural style modelling based on description logic as an abstract, meta-level modelling instrument. Architectural styles are often neglected in software architectures. We introduce a framework for style definition and style combination. The link between quality requirements and conceptual modelling of architectural styles is investigated. The application of the ontological framework in the form of an integration into existing architectural description notations such as ACME and UML-based approaches, and also service ontologies is illustrated.

Abstract: The term co-evolution describes the symbiotic relationship between dynamically changing business environments and the software that supports them. Business changes create pressures on the software to evolve, and at the same time technology changes create pressures on the business to evolve. More generally, we are concerned with systems where it is neither economically nor technologically feasible to suspend the operation of the system while it is being evolved. Typically these are long-lived systems in which dynamic co-evolution, whereby a system evolves as part of its own execution in reaction to both predicted and emergent events, is the only feasible option for change. Examples of such systems include continuously running business process models, sensor nets, grid applications, self-adapting/tuning systems, routing systems, control systems, autonomic systems, and pervasive computing applications. Active architectures address both the structural and behavioural requirements of dynamic co-evolving software by modelling software architecture as part of the on-going computation, thereby allowing evolution during execution and formal checking that desired system properties are preserved through evolution. This invited paper presents results on active architectures from the Compliant System Architecture and ArchWare projects. We have designed and constructed the ArchWare-ADL, a formal, well-founded architecture description language, based on the higher-order typed p-calculus, which consists of a set of layers to address the requirements of active architectures. The ArchWare-ADL design principles, concepts and formal notations are presented together with its sophisticated reflective technologies for supporting active architectures and thereby dynamic co-evolution.

Abstract: Software architectures suffer of a serious lack of documented design decisions, but also an explicit definition of the processes needed to create and exploit such architectural knowledge. To address these issues, we focus on the specification of those activities that we believe should be implemented to support the creation and use of design rationale with tool support. (14 refs)

Abstract: Most of the research in the area of multimodality discusses either the usability aspect of multimodality or the multimodality support given by or missing in certain markup languages. The overall architectural side of large multimodal systems is unfortunately not adequately represented in today’s literature. This report shows some results obtained during the implementation of such a system, e.g., the use of the multimodal interaction framework and how a staged architecture can be combined with this framework to achieve domain independence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a compositional formal approach to design correct publish/subscribe architecture styles. We provide a set of patterns and the corresponding composition rules to build architecture styles. The defined patterns and rules respect the principle of information propagation requiring that produced information have to reach all the subscribed consumers. We describe patterns as graphs and we use the Z notation to specify formally the semantic of each pattern and each rule. We prove consistency and correctness using the Z-Eves theorem prover. We show how to consider the interconnection topology between dispatchers as well as the subscription mechanism by simple refinements. We also show how to construct the Z specification of the designed architecture style based on applied rules. Moreover, we describe the dynamics of architecture via guarded graph-rewriting rules whose body describe the structural constraints and whose guards mainly describe the functional constraints of the system. We express these rules entirely with the Z notation also, obtaining a unified approach which handles both the static and the dynamic aspects. (17 refs)

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic case study that analyzes the influence exerted by different styles over the nature of architectural crosscutting concerns in an evolving multi-agent system. The analysis encompassed the systematic comparison of alternative architecture decompositions for the same application that changed over time to address different stakeholders’ concerns. (9 refs)

Abstract: Frameworks are an important form of reuse. However, they are often complex and hard to understand, what limits their success as a reuse option. To answer this problem, it has been widely recognized the need to effectively communicate frameworks and provide appropriate tool support, but difficulties still endure. We argue that the properties of frameworks are another aspect that is decisive for reuse problems and has not been sufficiently explored. We discuss these issues and we propose a framework architectural model that can be used to design frameworks that are easier to reuse. (8 refs)

Abstract: There is a recognized gap between requirements and architectures. There is also evidence that architecture evaluation, when done at the early phases of the development lifecycle, is an effective way to ensure the quality attributes of the final system. As quality attributes may be satisfied at a different extent by different alternative architectural solutions, an exploration and evaluation of alternatives is often needed. In order to address this issue at the requirements level, we propose to model architectures using the i* framework, a goal-oriented modelling language that allows to represent the functional and non-functional requirements of an architecture using actors and dependencies instead of components and connectors. Once the architectures are modelled, we propose guidelines for the generation of alternative architectures based upon existing architectural patterns, and for the definition of structural metrics for the evaluation of the resulting alternative models. The applicability of the approach is shown with the home service robot case study. (28 refs)

Abstract: Automated services help enterprises create new value from reuse of software and resources and achieve new levels of agility through greater flexibility and lower cost structures. As services come in many flavors and guises they have differing characteristics. In this paper we describe the most necessary aspects and features of automated services. We also focus on the interplay of SOAs and Business Process Management technologies and argue that the key enablers for Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) should focus on four inter-related elements: engineering and planning the SOA, SOA implementation, SOA management and monitoring and SOA governance.
