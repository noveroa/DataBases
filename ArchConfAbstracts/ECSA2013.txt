Abstract: Access to previously made architectural design decisions allows for faster understanding and more educated decisions during software evolution. Templates and ontologies have been proposed to document such decisions. In this paper we argue that documenting the architectural design decisions can be intertwined with a standard architecture documentation process. For that, we propose architecture-specific decision types equipped with OCL constraints capable for decision conformance checks. We present an initial evaluation based on a preliminary case study with a typical three-tier web-application and the decisions associated with its implementation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (12 refs)

Abstract: Due to the increasingly complexity of industry software products, software architecture evaluation is getting important to effectively identify potential risks and ensure the quality goals of the resulting system are well addressed in the design phase. However, despite the plethora of evaluation approaches proposed in academia, few of them have proven suitable to evaluate architecture designs of wide spread industry applications. As the initial efforts of addressing this issue, this paper identifies the gaps between an ideal industry friendly software architecture evaluation approach and existing evaluation methods. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: With the evolution of distributed systems in size and complexity, software deployment remains a challenging task. Despite the existence of several approaches, most of them use informal models that lack a solid mathematic foundation. In this paper, we propose a bigraphical based approach for modeling and formalizing the deployment of distributed applications. This approach relies on multi-scale modeling. So, we start by modeling the first scale with a bigraph. This bigraph is enriched, through a series of reaction rules, until reaching the last scale that represents the deployment architecture. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (9 refs)

Abstract: The swap mechanism allows an operating system to work with more memory than available RAM space, by temporarily flushing some data to disk. However, the system sometimes ends up spending more time swapping data in and out of disk than performing actual computation. This state is called thrashing. Classical strategies against thrashing rely on reducing system load, so as to decrease memory pressure and increase global throughput. Those approaches may however be counterproductive when tricked into advantaging malicious or long-standing processes. This is particularily true in the context of shared hosting or virtualization, where multiple users run uncoordinated and selfish workloads. To address this challenge, we propose an accounting layer that forces swap fairness among processes competing for main memory. It ensures that a process cannot monopolize the swap subsystem by delaying the swap operations of abusive processes, reducing the number of system-wide page faults while maximizing memory utilization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Inadequate version control has been identified as a major obstacle to the application of model-driven software engineering. In particular, sophisticated support for merging model versions is urgently needed. We present a tool for merging of EMF models which may be applied to instances of arbitrary Ecore models. The tool advances the state of the art by guaranteeing a consistent merge result. Furthermore, it detects and resolves not only context-free, but also context-sensitive conflicts. Our merge tool is model-based; it relies on EMF for its implementation. Initial experiences gained from its application confirm that the merge tool operates both accurately and efficiently. © 2013 ACM. (28 refs)

Abstract: During the last years, the area of Service Science Management and Engineering (SSME) is one of those fields that have benefit from the advantages brought by Model-Driven Engineering in terms of leveraging the abstraction level at which software is conceived, designed or even implemented. One of the key issues in SSME is evolution, given the non-trivial nature of updating widely distributed and heterogeneous systems. In this context, this work introduces an EMF-based toolkit that bundles different DSLs, injectors/extractors and transformations to put into practice and explore some formal theories on the evolution of Web Services. © 2013 ACM.

Abstract: This paper presents a tool called MTC Flow, which allows model-driven developers to design, develop, test and deploy Model Transformation Chains (MTCs). The tool offers a graphical DSL for defining MTC workflow models independently of the technologies that support the transformations. Using basic concepts such as metamodels, models and transformations (M2M, M2T and T2M) the user defines, executes and tests his MTC easily in the same development environment. MTC Flow has an abstraction layer to implement technology support. It facilitates the interoperability of model transformation and validation using the existing technologies without changes. Additionally, once the MTC is finished, MTC Flow offers an option to deploy it in any environment that support JAVA technology. The tool supports modularity and alternative execution paths of the MTCs. It was built on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF). The tool offers a development environment using the extending capabilities of the Eclipse platform. We illustrate how MTC Flow supports MTCs development process using an example. © 2013 ACM.

Abstract: UML modeling environments for doing model-based testing are often not very comfortable to use and burden some knowledge about the internals of UML to the users, respectively test engineers. Test engineers, however, are seldom experts in UML, thus, the gain of efficiency model-based testing approaches entail, is reduced by a too generic tooling. The tool Fokus!MBT, developed by the competence center MOTION of Fraunhofer FOKUS, is a multi-paradigmatic test modeling environment based on the UML Testing Profile, an OMG-adopted industry-driven notation for model-based testing. Fokus!MBT simplifies the creation and authoring of test models with methodology-specific support. It is built on top of Eclipse Papyrus, a powerful open source UML modeling environment, which, in turn, relies on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Graphical Modeling Framework. This paper provides deep insights into the basic concepts and technical realization of Fokus!MBT as well as into the lessons we have learned during development and application. © 2013 ACM. (36 refs)

Abstract: In our work, we promote a new discipline for secure and dependable system engineering using a pattern as its first class citizen: Pattern-Based System Engineering (PBSE). Therefore, PBSE addresses two kind of processes: the one of pattern development and the one of system development with patterns. To interconnect these two processes we promote a structured model-based repository of patterns and their related property models. This paper presents the SEMCO MDE Tool Suite development status conducted in the context of the FP7 TERESA project aiming to support the automation of building, storing and processing reusable artifacts (S&D patterns and property models). This tool promotes the PBSE methodology in the domain of assistance to the trusted embedded system engineering.

Abstract: In many domains, models are created based on predefined metamodels which abstract the structure of the domain in question. However, there are specific domains, like Enterprise Architecture (EA) projects, where a metamodel cannot be defined in advance to the creation of the model. Unfortunately, in this situation using standard frameworks, like EMF, generates some inconveniences in the construction of the model and the metamodel because these frameworks do not support the manipulation of metamodels at runtime. In this paper, we propose a strategy to co-create metamodels and models in an incremental and simultaneous way. This proposal is supported by a dynamic approach that separates the linguistic and the ontological conformity concerns of metamodeling. This strategy has been implemented in a graphical editor called GraCoT, which also provides interactive assistance to guide the users during the co-creation process. © 2013 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: Since the groundbreaking work of Kamin, Reddy, and particularly Cook in the late 1980s, there has been broad agreement that the meaning of inheritance in object-oriented programming languages can be best explained using generator functions and their fixpoints. Consequently, it is a little surprising to realise that no current mainstream programming language actually explains inheritance to its users in this way. Instead, most languages make up a “story” that purports to explain inheritance, but that on closer inspection contains serious flaws. It is as if, being asked to explain the facts of life to our children, we are so embarrassed by the truth that we make up a story about storks, knowing even as we do so that it defies the laws not only of biology but also of physics. This paper explores both the truth and the fictions about how objects are brought into the world. My hope is that future programming languages can tell the children, if not the whole truth, then at least a partial truth that is consistent with the laws of mathematics.

Abstract: The simplest and purest practical object-oriented language designs today are seen in dynamically-typed languages, such as Smalltalk and Self. Static types, however, have potential benefits for productivity, security, and reasoning about programs. In this paper, we describe the design ofWyvern, a statically typed, pure object-oriented language that attempts to retain much of the simplicity and expressiveness of these iconic designs. Our goals lead us to combine pure object-oriented and functional abstractions in a simple, typed setting. We present a foundational object-based language that we believe to be as close as one can get to simple typed lambda calculus while keeping objectorientation. We show how this foundational language can be translated to the typed lambda calculus via standard encodings.We then define a simple extension to this language that introduces classes and show that classes are no more than sugar for the foundational object-based language. Our future intention is to demonstrate that modules and other object-oriented features can be added to our language as not more than such syntactical extensions while keeping the object-oriented core as pure as possible. The design of Wyvern closely follows both historical and modern ideas about the essence of object-orientation, suggesting a new way to think about a minimal, practical, typed core language for objects.

Abstract: This position paper argues that inheritance and parameterization differ in their fundamental structure, even though they may emulate each other in many ways. Based on this, we claim that certain mechanisms, e.g., final classes, are in conflict with the nature of inheritance, and hence causes language designs to be less generalizable and more prone to semantic conflicts, and hence we recommend that these mechanisms should be optimized for playing different roles in language design.

Abstract: Feature-oriented programming extends object-oriented programming to support feature modularity. Feature modules typically cut across class boundaries to implement end-uservisible features. Customized program variants can be composed automatically given a selection of desired feature modules. We propose behavioral feature interfaces based on design by contract for precise localization of faulty feature modules. There are three different approaches for feature-module composition, which are considered to be equivalent in the literature. We discuss advantages and disadvantages for each approach with regard to behavioral feature interfaces. Based on our insights, we present Subclack as a new approach for feature-module composition combining the advantages of all existing approaches. In our examples, we use contracts defined in an feature-oriented extension of the Java Modeling Language, and discuss how they can be checked by means of runtime assertions. (33 refs)

Abstract: Dust storms are normally considered to be natural hazards. During such events, dust aerosol is loaded into the atmosphere, directly reducing visibility and effectively reflecting solar radiation back to space. In the present study, an intense dust storm was monitored during the first week of June 2010 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua data over the Indian region. A dust cloud was detected using a combination of MODIS reflective and emissive channels and moving trace/spread monitored by its multi-temporal data. The MODIS Terra-derived aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) and the aerosol index (AI) obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were used in conjunction with National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis wind fields for the monitoring of dust clouds. The study reveals that the movement of a high concentration of dust clouds coincided with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis meridional and zonal wind fields (>8 m s-1) at pressure levels of 700 hPa. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSOs) that derive vertical feature mask images also suggested that the vertical extent of the dust aerosol layer was at a height of about 6 km over northern India on 2 June 2010. The roles of long-range transport of dust over the entire Gangetic plane are analysed using back trajectories from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Back trajectory analysis suggests that dust clouds moving over long distances entered from the western side of India on 1 June 2010. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. (25 refs)

Abstract: Graphene single nanosheet (GNS) is synthesized from graphite by chemical oxidation and thermal exfoliation at 1000 °C and confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscope images clearly show the lateral expansion of graphite sheet and uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on GNS. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses are conducted for surface properties of GNS such as oxygenated functional groups. Cyclic voltammetric analysis shows that electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs) for Pt/GNS, commercial Pt/Vulcan XC-72 carbon black and Pt-incorporated onto commercial carbon black (Pt/CB) prepared in the laboratory are 33.1 m2 g-1, 23.5 m 2 g-1 and 22.5 m2 g-1, respectively. Because of significant restacking of Pt/GNS sheets, carbon black (CB) with different content is intercalated between Pt/GNS as a spacer. The ECSAs of Pt/GNS, Pt/GNS/CB20, Pt/GNS/CB30 and Pt/GNS/CB40 are evaluated to be 31.5 m 2 g-1, 28.6 m2 g-1, 38.8 m 2 g-1 and 30.4 m2 g-1, respectively. The cell performance highly depends on CB content and Pt/GNS/CB with 30 wt.% of CB content shows the best cell performance of 400 mA cm-2. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. (28 refs)

Abstract: Ni nanoparticles with a dimension ranging between 80 and 200nm were synthesized by a microwave-assisted polyol route. The reaction was carried out at 200°C in diethylenglycol (DEG) in the presence of a binary chelating agent system (polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP and dodecylamine DDA), in order to obtain stable and highly concentrated nanosols whose ratio was carefully optimized. Stable suspensions were produced with the future prospect of improving the performance of the anodic layer in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), in which the metal is employed as catalyst. Studying the influence of different reaction times on the final product, it was possible to identify the reaction path that goes through the formation, after 10min, of crystalline Ni-glycolate that turns completely into crystalline Ni metal after 20min. The as obtained Ni nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, TG-DTA, FT-IR, TEM. Preliminary tests on their catalytic and electrochemical activities were carried out by studying the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to p-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of NaBH4 as probe reaction and by calculating the electrochemically active surface area (AECSA) with cyclic voltammetry. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: This work illustrates the utility and improved performance of nitrogen-modified catalyst supports for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. A unique two-step vapor-phase synthesis procedure is used to achieve the N-modification and Pt-Ru decoration of high surface-area carbon powders relevant to integration as electrocatalysts in fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). First, nitrogen surface moieties are incorporated into a commercial high surface area carbon support via a N-ion implantation technique, followed by Pt-Ru nanoparticle deposition via magnetron sputtering. The nitrogen-ion implantation of high surface area carbon supports yields superior Pt-Ru catalyst particle stability and performance as compared to industry standards. Specifically, results indicate a higher retention of metal catalyst surface area and electrochemical activity after accelerated electrochemical degradation testing. Further, characterization of catalyst materials before, during and after the electrochemical cycling provides insight into the catalyst particle coarsening and/or catalyst surface area loss mechanisms that dominate this fuel cell catalyst system.

Abstract: Potential cycling tests using 42.2 wt% and 19.1 wt% Pt/C catalysts were conducted by the RRDE technique to evaluate the changes in the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and H2O2 formation ability of the catalysts. As the typical operating conditions of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), square wave potential cycling (0.7-0.9 V) was applied to the catalysts for 150,000 cycles in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte. During the potential cycling test, electrochemical measurements were carried out to characterize the ECSA, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and H2O2 formation. After 150,000 potential cyclings, while the ECSA of the 42.2 wt% Pt/C dropped by 35%, the ECSA loss for the 19.1 wt% Pt/C was 55%. This result implies that the Pt content in the cathode catalyst affects the ECSA loss during the long-term PEMFC operation. Additionally, the H2O2 formation ratio obviously increased with the potential cycling only in the case of the 19.1 wt% Pt/C. In order to verify the H2O2 formation dependence on the ECSA, four types of catalysts, which included different Pt loading amounts (42.2, 28.1, 19.1 and 9.5 wt% Pt/C), were evaluated, and these results explained the relationship between the ECSA decay and H2O2 formation increase in the durability tests. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Measurement of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of fuel cell electrodes is a key diagnostic of performance and gives a useful parameter for monitoring degradation and state of health in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, conventional methods for determining ECSA require potentiostatic control of the cell, which is impractical in a fuel cell stack. Here we demonstrate for the first time the practical application of a galvanostatic technique that enables in situ monitoring of ECSA in each cell throughout the lifetime of a stack. The concept is demonstrated at single cell level using both H adsorption and CO stripping, and the H adsorption (cathodic current) method is extended to stack testing. The undesirable effects of H 2 crossover on the measurement may be minimised by appropriate selection of current density and by working with dilute H2 on the anode electrode. Good agreement is achieved with ECSA values determined using conventional single cell voltammetry across a range of MEA designs. The technique is straightforward to implement and provides an invaluable tool for state of health monitoring during PEMFC stack lifetime studies. Crown Copyright © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The global convergence of elitist clonal selection algorithm (ECSA) in additive noisy environment is studied by using stochastic process. The Markov chain that models ECSA in noisy environment is constructed by a new state representation method named ordered pair. The evolutionary sequence best fitness functions is described as a submartingale, and the global convergence of the best fitness functions is derived based on martingale theory. The transition probability characteristics of the clonal selection algorithm in additive noisy environment are analyzed; by this property we conclude that ECSA is eventually globally convergent with probability 1 in additive noisy environment.

Abstract: Measurement of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of fuel cell electrodes is a key diagnostic of performance and gives a useful parameter for monitoring degradation and state of health in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, conventional methods for determining ECSA require potentiostatic control of the cell, which is impractical in a fuel cell stack. Here we demonstrate for the first time the practical application of a galvanostatic technique that enables in situ monitoring of ECSA in each cell throughout the lifetime of a stack. The concept is demonstrated at single cell level using both H adsorption and CO stripping, and the H adsorption (cathodic current) method is extended to stack testing. The undesirable effects of H2 crossover on the measurement may be minimised by appropriate selection of current density and by working with dilute H2 on the anode electrode. Good agreement is achieved with ECSA values determined using conventional single cell voltammetry across a range of MEA designs. The technique is straightforward to implement and provides an invaluable tool for state of health monitoring during PEMFC stack lifetime studies. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: In order to achieve reliable data regarding high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell degradation (HT-PEFC) a novel diagnostic technique for electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) determination was developed. In situ cyclovoltammetric monolayer CO oxidation charge measurements were combined with real-time CO2 exhaust gas analysis. Different evaluating methods were developed to overcome the problem of side reactions during CO stripping. Furthermore, a calibration curve for absolute ECSA determination via CO stripping was established. These methods were additionally successfully extended and implemented to locally resolved ECSA measurements. In summary, this paper introduces novel fundamental HT-PEFC diagnostics for improved understanding of degradation phenomena. © The Electrochemical Society. (10 refs)

Abstract: Here we have derived a simple expression to relate faradaic pseudo-capacitance, CF, determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Pt electrocatalysts. To test this expression, two commercially available Pt/C catalysts were subjected to accelerated degradation testing protocol (ADTP) during which catalyst layer health was assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and EIS to monitor the degradation process. CF was determined by acquiring the EIS response at two different DC bias potentials: the first at a bias potential where the faradaic process was present, and the second at a bias potential where only double layer capacitance was present which enables accurate tracking of changes in CF throughout the ADTP. A near-identical decay profile for both ECSA (determined by CV) and CF (determined by EIS) was observed, providing an excellent fit to the derived expression. Using the EIS model, similar potential-dependant proportionality constants were determined for hydrogen adsorption/desorption on each catalyst indicating that they are universally applicable across Pt catalysts. These constants can therefore be used to effectively determine ECSA values without performing CV measurements. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. (36 refs)

Abstract: High performance and electrochemically stable Pt/graphene catalysts assisted with polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA) have been synthesized for PEM fuel cells. The preparation procedure and properties of the catalysts are investigated in detail. With the introduction of PDDA molecules, Pt nanoparticles can be well-dispersed on graphene support, resulting in improved electrochemical surface area and enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The corresponding electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) of catalyst layers calculated from the hydrogen desorption peak on cyclic voltammogram curves are 78.3, 72.5 and 73.6 cm2 g-1 for catalyst layers with Pt/graphene, Pt-PDDA/graphene, and Pt/graphene-PDDA catalysts, respectively. Both PDDA modified Pt nanoparticles and PDDA modified graphene supports also exhibit high durability toward electrochemical oxidation cycles compared with the conventional produced Pt/graphene catalyst at the same conditions. After 3000 cycles, only 23.52% of the initial ECSA remains for Pt/graphene electrocatalyst whereas 43.04% and 37.7% of the initial ECSA for the Pt/graphene-PDDA and Pt-PDDA/graphene catalysts remain, respectively. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Graphitic-carbon nitride materials (gCNM) are investigated for developing highly-durable catalyst supports for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The gCNMs are more electrochemically stable compared to conventional carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) following accelerated corrosion testing. After 2000 scans, the gCNM shows a 133% increase in double-layer capacitance compared to 166% for Vulcan. Despite the low initial electrochemical surface area (ECSA), Pt/gCNM electrocatalyst exhibits improved durability over Pt/Vulcan, with 20.9% ECSA loss versus 41.0% for Pt/Vulcan after 1000 scans. Superior methanol oxidation activity is observed for Pt/gCNM on the basis of the catalyst ECSA. © The Electrochemical Society. (73 refs)

Abstract: Through a bromide-induced galvanic replacement reaction between Pd nanowires and K2PtCl6, PtPd porous nanorods are successfully synthesized. With such interesting porous and alloy-structured PtPd nanorods as cathode catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), obvious advantages are shown evidently in the electrochemical studies. First, the porous structure shows large electrochemical surface area (ECSA), thus providing an efficient way to reduce the usage of expensive noble metals. Second, due to the large surface area and the synergistic effect of alloy crystalline phase, the resulting porous nanorods exhibit enhanced catalytic activity for ORR compared to the Pd nanowires and commercial Pt/C catalyst. Third, the PtPd porous nanorods exhibit excellent durability in ORR with only 5.88% loss of the initial ECSA after the accelerated durability tests (1000 potential cycles), whereas the Pd nanowires and commercial Pt/C catalyst lose 21.6% and 40.4% of their original ECSA. Such porous nanorods appear to be promising cathode electrocatalysts for fuel cells with enlarged surface area, enhanced catalytic activity and improved durability.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. (38 refs)

Abstract: In recent years, progress has been made in the analysis of global convergence of clonal selection algorithms (CSA), but most analyses are based on the theory of Markov chain, which depend on the description of the transition matrix and eigenvalues. However, such analyses are very complicated, especially when the population size is large, and are presented for particular implementations of CSA. In this paper, instead of the traditional Markov chain theory, we introduce martingale theory to prove the convergence of a class of CSA, called elitist clonal selection algorithm (ECSA). Using the submartingale convergence theorem, the best individual affinity evolutionary sequence is described as a submartingale, and the almost everywhere convergence of ECSA is derived. Particularly, the algorithm is proved convergent with probability 1 in finite steps when the state space of population is finite. This new proof of global convergence analysis of ECSA is more simplified and effective, and not implementation specific. (18 refs)

Abstract: In the presented work we investigate the influence of the Pt to carbon ratio on the degradation behavior of Pt based proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) catalysts. In order to enable a systematic investigation, we utilized a recently developed colloidal synthesis approach for preparing catalysts with identical Pt nanoparticles (NPs), but varying Pt loadings. Two different commercially available, standard carbon supports were used, Vulcan XC72 and Ketjenblack EC-300. We evaluated the influence of the platinum loading on the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss by applying accelerated stress tests simulating a load-cycle in a PEMFC and start-up/shutdown conditions. Simulating load cycles, no clear influence of the Pt loading on the ECSA loss is observed, whereas the ECSA loss significantly increases with increasing Pt loading when simulating start-up/shutdown conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: We examined the durability of a carbon-supported Pt-based Co alloy catalyst (Pt-Co/C) during voltage cycling tests under supersaturated humidity conditions to simulate events such as flooding. The voltage cycling tests were conducted from 0.4 V to 1 V for up to 50,000 cycles using 100% relative humidity (RH) hydrogen as the anode gas and 189% RH nitrogen as the cathode gas. We performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) to evaluate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and investigated polarization properties to evaluate the activity of Pt-Co/C. The ECSA of Pt-Co/C decreased more slowly than that of a platinum catalyst (Pt/C) during tests (percentages of initial ECSA were 62% and 37% for Pt-Co/C and Pt/C, respectively), either because (1) initial Pt-Co/C was not dispersed unlike Pt/C, or (2) Pt/C exhibited stronger resistance to agglomeration than Pt-Co/C. We concluded that Pt-Co/C exhibited high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability during voltage cycling tests because the mass activity of Pt-Co/C was about twice that of Pt/C throughout the 50,000 cycles. Electrocatalytic specific activities of Pt-Co/C were constant and about twice those of Pt/C for 4000-50,000 cycles, indicating that alloying can increase intrinsic activity for up to 50,000 cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Viewing angle enlargement is essential for SLM-based 3D holographic display. An idea of constructing equivalent-curved-SLM-array (ECSA) is proposed by linear phase factor superimposition. Employing the time division and spatial tiling (TDST) techniques, an ECSA-based horizontal 4f optical system is designed and built. The horizontal viewing angle of a single SLM is increased to 3.6 times when retaining the same hologram area. An interlaced holographic display technique is developed to remove the flicker effect. Holographic augmented reality is performed using the TDST system. Floating holographic 3D image with parallax and accommodation effects is achieved. Both TDST and interlaced technique may extend to multiple SLMs system to achieve larger viewing angle. © 2013 Optical Society of America. (22 refs)

Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) modified TiO2 was synthesized using a sol-gel procedure and evaluated for use as an electrocatalyst support. Platinumnanoparticles were deposited on this support via the incipient wetness method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nitrogen desorption were used to investigate their microstructure. Of the formulations studied, Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 possessed an adequate powder electronic conductivity of 0.2 S/cm. The capacitance of this Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 support changed by only 12% whereas the pseudocapacitance of a carbon benchmark changed by over 100% over 10,000 support stability test cycles (support stability test protocol: 1.0-1.5 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 500 mV/s in a 0.1MHClO4 electrolyte at 25?C) under identical test conditions. The stability of 20% Pt/Ta0.3Ti 0.7O2, 20% Pt/C, and 46% Pt/C (commercial, TKK) catalysts were evaluated by monitoring the evolution of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) under load cycling (load cycling protocol: 0.6-0.95 V vs. RHE with a dwell time of 3 s at either potentials in a 0.1 MHClO4 electrolyte at 25?C). The loss in ECSA in 20% Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 was found to be 35% compared to 44-47% for 20% Pt/C and 46% Pt/C over 10,000 load cycles. 20% Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 yielded the following performance-related metrics: the ECSA of this electrocatalyst was 41 m2/g, the mass activity and area-specific activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) determined at 0.9 V vs. RHE in a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte at 25?C were 62 mA/mgPt and 151 µA/cm2 Pt, respectively. Koutecky-Levich analysis carried out to evaluate ORR kinetics suggested that all 3 catalysts (20% Pt/Ta 0.3Ti0.7O2, 20% Pt/C and 46% Pt/C) demonstrated similar ORR mechanisms. We propose that Ta0.3Ti0.7O 2 shows outstanding promise as a corrosion-resistant alternative to carbon as an electrocatalyst support in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: A controlled composition-based method - that is, the microwave-assisted ethylene glycol (MEG) method - was successfully developed to prepare bimetallic PtxRu100-x/C nanoparticles (NPs) with different alloy compositions. This study highlights the impact of the variation in alloy composition of PtxRu100-x/C NPs on their alloying extent (structure) and subsequently their catalytic activity towards the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The alloying extent of these PtxRu 100-x/C NPs has a strong influence on their Pt d-band vacancy and Pt electroactive surface area (Pt ECSA); this relationship was systematically evaluated by using X-ray absorption (XAS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and electrochemical analyses. The MOR activity depends on two effects that act in cooperation, namely, the number of active Pt sites and their activity. Here the number of active Pt sites is associated with the Pt ECSA value, whereas the Pt-site activity is associated with the alloying extent and Pt d-band vacancy (electronic) effects. Among the PtxRu100-x/C NPs with various Pt:Ru atomic ratios (x=25, 50, and 75), the Pt75Ru 25/C NPs were shown to be superior in MOR activity on account of their favorable alloying extent, Pt d-band vacancy, and Pt ECSA. This short study brings new insight into probing the synergistic effect on the surface reactivity of the PtxRu100-x/C NPs, and possibly other bimetallic Pt-based alloy NPs. Control and catalysis: This study reports a controlled composition-based synthesis and characterization of selected bimetallic PtxRu100-x/C nanoparticles and simultaneously demonstrates their physiochemical properties - that is, their alloying extent and electronic structure - by focusing on the catalytic activity (see figure). A methanol oxidation reaction was used as a model system. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. (68 refs)

Abstract: The mass activity is intensively used as characterization parameters for evaluation of the effectiveness of the cathode catalyst in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this work, the dependence of mass activity on platinum loading was studied at the cathode. The results indicated that the mass activity and the utilized electrochemical surface area of the catalyst are not independent of the catalyst loading. The electrochemical specific surface area (ECSA) and the mass activity increase as the loading is decreased. The increase of the ECSA is attributed to the increase of the utilization of the catalyst. The commonly applied Tafel-approximation cannot be used to fit the result because the mass activity is controlled not only by RO and the ORR kinetics, but also the utilization of the catalyst, which in turn depends on catalyst loading, the structure of the catalyst layer, the degree of agglomeration, and screening of the catalyst particles. A detailed and more precise definition of mass activity (MA) is given to elucidate the variation of MA with catalyst loading. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. (39 refs)

Abstract: Functionalized (N, O) carbon nanotubes supported Pt electrocatalysts with high surface area and small average particle diameter (2 nm) are synthesized by the polyol method using microwave irradiation. Physical and electrochemical methods are used to characterize the surface and the structure of the catalysts and supports. The stability of the catalysts is evaluated through an accelerated stress test by fast potential cycling monitoring changes in electrochemical behavior with cyclic voltammetry and polarization curves. Characterization indicates that the Pt particle size is comparable for all samples and is about 2 nm with a Pt loading depending on the carbon nanotubes employed in synthesis. The accelerated stress test demonstrates that the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) are relatively stable and only a small and non-linear decay is observed, which is much lower than with carbon black-supported samples. Strikingly, the ECSA loss is virtually independent of the composition/functionalisation of the CNTs. Initial stronger changes in ECSA are tentatively attributed to initial structural changes in the catalyst, which are more pronounced for CNT and oxygen-functionalized CNT (OCNT) supported samples. Concurrently, the surface specific activity initially changes strongly in the latter samples, while it does not for the nitrogen-functionalized CNT (NCNT) supported catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Controlling the morphologies of Pt nanocrystals provide effective opportunities to promote the electrochemical properties and enhance the mass activity. Recently we have reported that Pluronic F127 (PEO 100PPO65PEO100) could serve as reducing reagent for synthesis of highly electrocatalytic activity of branched Pt nanocrystal. Herein, we further synthesize another novel Pt nanosponge foil (Pt-NSF) under the same system with Pluronic F127. We expect to build the relationship between block copolymer system and morphology design of synthesized nanocrystal with specific electrochemical property. The electrochemical active areas (ECSA) of Pt-NSF and Pt-black are of the order of 20 m2 g-1. On one hand, step atoms, dislocations, grain boundaries, which observed from HRTEM (high resolution transmission electron microscope), are all prevalent on Pt-NSF, which could serve as active adsorption sites. On the other hand, Pt-NSF looks like an aggregation of many Pt-black nanoparticles, the connection formed skeleton is conducive to electron transfer. These reasons aroused the mass activity and the specific activity of Pt-NSF were much higher than each of Pt-black toward the oxygen reduction reaction activity (ORR) at 0.9 V respectively. Durability tests show that the ECSA of Pt-NSF and Pt-black declined, but the activity of Pt-NSF toward the ORR was almost unchanged. The impact of structures on the electrochemical properties is described in detail. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (32 refs)

Abstract: Hybrid-typed Pt electrocatalyst using Pt-carbon molecular sieve (Pt-CMS) synthesized by zeolite template method and commercial Pt-carbon black (Pt-CB) is prepared with different ratios of Pt-CB to Pt-CMS. Their physical and electrochemical properties are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron micrograph (TEM) and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method (BET). Pt nanoparticles of 2-4 nm are synthesized and successfully dispersed onto CMS by polyol method and comparable with that of commercial Pt-CB. Cyclic voltammetric analysis is conducted to estimate electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The cell test is conducted for the various membrane electrolyte assemblies (MEAs) fabricated with different catalysts such as Pt-CB, Pt-CMS, various hybrid-typed Pt-CBx/Pt-CMS100-x named as Pt-CBx/CMS100-x. The cell performance is fairly consistent with ECSA and the MEA fabricated with equal mass fraction of Pt-CB and Pt-CMS (Pt-CB50/CMS50) shows the best cell performance, indicating a significant dependence on pore structure of carbon support. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The corrosion of carbon black (CB) support materials for polymer electrolyte fuel cells was investigated by use of two standard accelerated testing protocols, square wave cycling (E = 0.9-1.3 V vs. RHE, holding 30 s at each E) and triangular wave cycling (E = 1.0-1.5 V vs. RHE, at a scan rate of 0.5 V s-1) protocols, which were operated with H2 (anode) and N2 (cathode) atmospheres at 80 °C and 100% RH. Severe decreases of the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), mass activity (MA@0.85 V) and cell performance resulting from the simulated start-up/shutdown cycling are ascribed to the detachment of Pt particles from the CB support due to carbon corrosion and structural collapse, as well as Ostwald ripening. First, the simulated start-up/shutdown cycling brings about the surface corrosion of the CB particles, and thereafter it transforms the crystalline carbon into amorphous carbon, which subsequently undergoes corrosion. This continual corrosion process of the CB support leads to a significant thickness reduction of the Pt/CB cathode catalyst layer and the severe detachment of Pt particles from the CB. On the CB particles, the slower square wave cycling brings about their overall corrosion, including the surface defects and anchoring centers where Pt particles are well attached and dispersed, whereas the faster triangular wave cycling brings about corrosion locally at more unstable surface defects on the CB particles. This is why the estimated cycle half-life N1/2 (at which ECSA is estimated to decrease to ca. 1/2 of the initial value) for the Pt/CB cathode catalyst was 10 times shorter with the square wave cycling compared to that with the triangular wave cycling. The effect of overall cycling time vs. cycle number is also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (54 refs)

Abstract: Computation on traditional CPU platforms consumes large amount of time owing to large SAR echo data and imaging algorithm complexity. GPU has the great advantage of many processing cores suitable for the acceleration of independent parallel structure algorithms. With the powerful floating point and parallel processing capabilities of GPU, the ECSA SAR imaging algorithm is verified on the GPU with good results, and the comprehensive (computation time + IO time) speedup has been raised. Since CUDA-GPU utilization will be the future of high resolution spaceborne SAR imaging, the paper gives a preliminary indication of the feasibility of GPU to process spaceborne SAR data, which lays the foundation for further procedure optimization.

Abstract: The platinum (Pt) particle electrocatalysts were fabricated by a surfactant-free, electro-deposition technique in the cyclic voltammetric mode for electro-oxidation of ammonia in aqueous solutions. The hierarchical Pt nanoparticles with various morphologies, including sheet-, flower-, prickly sphere- and cauliflower-like shapes, were obtained by controlling the electrodepositing parameters. The amount of Pt loading was determined by an inductively coupled plasma method, and the electrocatalytic activity of the prepared nano-Pt electrocatalysts for the ammonia oxidation was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that there is a remarkable effect of the surface morphology of Pt particles on the electrocatalytic activity. In particular, the hierarchical Pt particles have a much higher electrocatalytic activity for the ammonia oxidation than the smooth, spherical Pt particles. The improved electrocatalytic activity is attributed not only to the large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) achieved, but also to the high electrocatalytic activity per unit ECSA. Electro-deposition technique provides a promising alternative to fabricate high-performance electrocatalysts for oxidation of ammonia in aqueous solutions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Ta modified TiO2 was synthesized using a sol-gel procedure and evaluated for use as an electrocatalyst support. Of the materials evaluated, Ta0. 3Ti0. 7O2 exhibited remarkably high stability under aggressive potential cycling tests designed to mimic harsh automotive drive cycles. The capacitance of the Ta0. 3Ti 0. 7O2 support changed by 12% whereas the pseudocapacitance of a carbon benchmark changed by over 100% under identical test conditions. Pt/Ta0. 3Ti0. 7O2 electrocatalyst prepared by catalyzing this support showed high electrochemical stability which was attributed to a strong metal support interaction (SMSI); and fairly good performance. The stability of the catalyzed supports were evaluated by monitoring the evolution of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) under potential cycling, loss in ECSA of Pt/Ta0. 3Ti0. 7O 2 was found to be 35% compared to 46% for Pt/C over 10, 000 load cycles. Pt/Ta0. 3Ti0. 7O2 showed fairly good performance: the electrochemical surface area of this electrocatalyst was 41 m2/g, while the mass activity and areaspecific activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were 62 mA/mgPt and 151 µA/cm2 Pt, respectively, as ascertained from electrochemical experiments performed on a rotating disk electrode (RDE). Based on these results, we propose that Ta 0. 3Ti0. 7O2 is an excellent corrosion-resistant alternative to carbon as an electrocatalyst support. © The Electrochemical Society. (37 refs)

Abstract: We present experimental results obtained with a two-dimensional segmented cell with reference electrodes along the gas channels, used to record local anode and cathode potentials. Aging protocols consisting of repeated dead-ended anode operation sequences (with anode outlet closed) were performed to assess the impact of hydrogen starvation on the local fuel cell performance. We observed strong local cathode potential excursions, as well as nonuniform ElectroChemical Surface Area (ECSA) losses and performance degradation along the cell area. The damage was more pronounced in the regions suffering the longest from fuel starvation: i.e. close to the anode outlet. © The Electrochemical Society. (7 refs)

Abstract: In this study, platinum nanoparticles have been prepared using PtCl 4 as a starting material and 1-hexylamine, N-methylhexylamine, N,N-dimethylhexylamine, 1-heptylamine, N-methylheptylamine, and N,N-dimethylheptylamine as surfactants. All these surfactants were used in this synthesis, for the first time, to explore the effect of primary, secondary, and tertiary amine and chain length on the size and catalytic activity toward C1-C3 alcohol electro-oxidation. The electrochemical performance of all catalysts was determined using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. These techniques indicate that the highest electrocatalytic performance was generally observed when electrochemical surface area (ECSA), percent platinum utility, roughness factor, and the number of CH3 groups attached to the nitrogen atom is higher and the chain length shorter (C6H13). In addition, other important properties such as the crystal structure of platinum, size, and distribution of the platinum nanoparticles on the carbon support, and Pt(0) to Pt(IV) ratio, were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that increasing ECSA, Pt(0)/Pt(IV) ratio, % Pt utility, and roughness factor improves the C1-C3 alcohol oxidation catalytic performance. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Abstract: Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) are investigated as support materials of Pt catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Four types of Pt/OMC catalysts are prepared and their electrochemical performances and durability are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry using a rotating disk electrode system. Pt nanoparticles of 2-3 nm seem to be uniformly dispersed on the supports regardless of the kind of OMC. The different pore structure between CMK-3 and CMK-5 affects the surface areas of carbon supports and the resulting Pt nanoparticles with indicating that larger surface area accompanies higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Although the graphitization of carbon support from CMK-3 to CMK-3G reduces the surface area of carbon support, the surface area and the ORR activity of Pt nanoparticles on CMK-3G are increased. In general, the reductions in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and ORR activity become more noticeable in proportion to the initial ECSA and ORR of Pt/OMC after accelerated durability test. © The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: A new catalyst consisting of ionic liquid (IL)-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) obtained through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition support-enhanced electrocatalytic Pd nanoparticles (Pd@IL(Cl-)-CNTs) was successfully fabricated and applied in direct ethanol alkaline fuel cells. The morphology, structure, component and stability of Pd@IL(Cl-)-CNTs were systematic characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectra, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The new catalyst exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity, better tolerance and electrochemical stability than the Pd nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on CNTs (Pd@CNTs), which was ascribed to the effects of the IL, larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and greater processing performance. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at various scan rates illustrated that the oxidation behaviors of ethanol at all electrodes were controlled by diffusion processes. The investigation of the different counteranions demonstrated that the performance of the IL-CNTs hybrid material was profoundly influenced by the subtly varied structures of the IL moiety. All the results indicated that the Pd@IL(Cl-)-CNTs catalyst is an efficient anode catalyst, which has potential applications in direct ethanol fuel cells and the strategy of IL functionalization of CNTs could be available to prepare other carbonaceous carrier supports to enhance the dispersivity, stability, and catalytic performance of metal NPs as well. IL overachiever: A new ionic liquid (IL)-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) catalyst exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity, better tolerance, and electrochemical stability than the Pd nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on CNTs (see figure); this is ascribed to the effects of the IL, a larger electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and greater processing performance. The strategy of IL functionalization of CNTs could be available to prepare other carbonaceous carrier supports. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. (45 refs)

Abstract: Graphene-supported PtPd alloy nanocubes (PtPd/RGO) were synthesized via a facile and versatile one-pot hydrothermal synthetic strategy, which proved to be a universal technique for preparing other graphene-supported alloy nanocrystals. In acidic electrolyte, the PtPd/RGO composites exhibited much enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation compared to the unsupported PtPd alloy nanocubes with a similar size and shape, and the commercial Pt/C catalyst. More interestingly, we found that CO stripping is an efficient method to remove the surfactants wrapped on the particle surface and thus enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the Pt-based nanocrystals. After CO stripping treatment, the PtPd/RGO composites exhibited a much more negative onset potential of methanol oxidation than those of the unsupported PtPd alloy nanocubes and the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the treated PtPd/RGO displayed a mass-specific methanol oxidation activity of 198 mA/mg Metal at 0.62 V (vs Ag/AgCl), nearly 3.14 times higher than those of the unsupported PtPd alloy nanocubes (63 mA/mgMetal) and the commercial Pt/C catalyst (64 mA/mgMetal). On the other hand, the PtPd/RGO exhibited much higher stability during the methanol electrooxidation with almost no loss of the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and activity after 1000 electrochemical cycles. On the contrary, the unsupported PtPd nanocubes and the commercial Pt/C catalyst lost 8.5% and 25.7% of their initial ECSA, and 6.2% and 20.6% of the initial peak current after 1000 cycles of methanol oxidation reaction. The excellent stability of the PtPd/RGO can also be reflected from the fact that the morphology, size, and dispersity of the PtPd nanocubes exhibited no significant change after 1000 potential cycles. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Abstract: Sulfonated polymers, such as sulfonated polysulfone and sulfonated polyimide, are promising candidates as a future polyelectrolyte for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). In PEFC cell systems, the same polyelectrolyte material is often added to the electrocatalyst layer as the ionic path. We selected partially sulfonated poly(arylene thioethersulfone) (SPTES) and poly(2,2'-benzidinedisulfonicacid)-alt-(1,4,5,8- naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride) (BDSA-NTDA) as the electrolytes and wrapped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with the materials to which platinum nanoparticles (Pt) were attached onto the polyelectrolyte layer to fabricate new electrocatalysts. In these electrocatalysts, the MWNT and Pt serve as the electron path and reaction site, respectively. For both polyelectrolytes, Pt-nanoparticles mWNT/SPTES/Pt and MWNT/BDSA-NTDA/Pt possessed electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) of 42.3 and 35.6 m 2/g of Pt, respectively. Such a high ECSA efficiency ensures the use of these composites for the preparation of a future electrocatalyst. © 2013 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ) All rights reserved. (24 refs)

Abstract: A Pt-Co alloy catalyst supported on a Ta-doped Ti-oxide was investigated for the oxygen reduction reaction in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC) operating between 80 and 110°C at different relative humidity (100% and 33% R.H.). A crystalline anatase phase was obtained for the Ta-doped Ti-oxide support with BET surface area of about 150m2/g. Pt and Pt3Co1 nanoparticles dispersed on the Ta-doped Ti-oxide showed a crystallite size of 3.9 and 2.9nm, respectively. These catalysts were investigated in PEMFC and benchmarked against a carbon supported Pt3Co1 of similar crystallite size (Pt3Co1/C). Under automotive relevant operating conditions, i.e. at intermediate temperatures (110°C), and in the presence of low relative humidity (33% R.H.), the oxide-supported PtCo was approaching in performance the Pt3Co1/C catalyst. The performance of PtCo/oxide was better than that of Pt/oxide under all operating conditions. The oxide supported PtCo catalyst showed a lower electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and larger ohmic resistance with respect to the Pt3Co1/C. On the other hand, the oxide-supported catalysts appeared stable during an accelerated corrosion test at 1.4V RHE while a dramatic decrease of the ECSA was observed for the Pt3Co1/C under the same condition. Thus, the oxide supported PtCo alloy catalyst appears promising in terms of electrochemical stability and for automotive applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. (58 refs)

Abstract: The platinum (Pt) particle electrocatalysts supported on the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate were prepared by the pulsed electrodeposition for the methanol oxidation. The effect of the lower potential pulse duration (t l) of the electrodeposition on the surface morphology and structure of the Pt particles was investigated by the X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The amount of the Pt loading was determined by an inductively coupled plasma method, and the electrocatalytic activity of the prepared Pt electrocatalysts on the ITO for the methanol oxidation was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that the tl has a significant influence on the surface morphology of the Pt particles on the ITO substrate. As the tl decreases from 1 to 0.01 s, the deposited Pt particles on the ITO exhibit flower-, nanosheet-, prickly and smooth spherical-like morphology in turn. Furthermore, there is a remarkable effect of the surface morphology of the Pt particles on the electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation. Among all these morphologies, the flower- and nanosheet-like Pt particles on the ITO have a much higher mass specific activity (MA) for the methanol oxidation, and the Pt particles with prickly surface followed while the smooth spherical Pt particles have the lowest MA. In particular, the dispersed Pt nanosheets prepared at tl of 0.5 s has the highest MA. The much improved MA of the dispersed Pt nanosheets is attributed not only to the large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) achieved, but also to the high electrocatalytic activity per unit ECSA related to its special morphology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Pt/C and Pt3Ni/C electrocatalysts that contained 12-27 wt.% Pt were prepared via the reduction of precursors in a binary solvent. The metal loading, average size of the Pt or Pt alloy nanoparticles, and electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the obtained catalysts were found to be dependent on the choice of organic components and their relative amounts in the starting solution. Downsizing the nanoparticles was shown to favor the agglomeration processes that counterbalance the expected increase in the electrochemical surface area. This adverse effect of downsizing can be reduced through selection of the optimum binary solvent composition. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. (37 refs)

Abstract: In this report, calcium ions in the porous hydroxyapatite (HAp) microspheres are partially exchanged with ferrous ions to form iron contained hydroxyapatite (FeHAp) on which Pt ions in H2PtCl6 solution are reduced to form Pt/FeHAp catalyst and finally mixed with carbon blacks to derive Pt/FeHAp/C catalysts. They exhibit the characteristics of Pt (1 1 0) facet with a sharp desorption peak at -0.109 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) ranging from 73 to 224 m2 g-1 with little CO poisoning effect on Pt, and the mass activity ranging from 6.88 to 28.99 A gPt-1 in methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Besides, Pt/FeHAp reveals the lower onset potential in CO-stripping than Pt/C. These better performances of Pt/FeHAp/C catalysts, compared with Pt/C, are also related to the Pt (1 1 0) facet, the content of Fe, and the coexistence of Pt0 and Pt2+ in Pt/FeHAp. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract: A nano-scale understanding of the degradation mechanisms responsible for the performance loss of high surface area (HSA) catalysts implemented in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) is essential for the development of improved catalysts. Here we present a systematic study of the degradation mechanisms of a HSA carbon supported Pt (Pt/C) catalyst. By monitoring the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss under accelerated stress test (AST) protocols with identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM), it is shown that different degradation mechanisms are responsible of the performance loss of Pt/C depending on the applied AST protocol. Three different AST protocols have been applied, i.e. i) load cycles between 0.6-1.0V RHE, ii) start/stop cycles between 1.0-1.5VRHE, and iii) a treatment consisting of a mix of both conditions (cycling between 0.4-1.4V RHE). During load cycles the main degradation mechanisms are nanoparticle (NP) migration as well as Pt dissolution and re-deposition. However, after applying start/stop cycles only NP detachment from the carbon support is detect, whereas the third AST protocol induces all degradation modes concomitantly. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: We herein report a facile and effective ultrasonication method to non-covalently functionalize graphene with copper phthalocyanine-3,4', 4?,4aˆ&euro´-tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (TSCuPc) as a promising catalyst support for Pt nanoparticles. With the assistance of TSCuPc, Pt nanoparticles are homogeneously deposited on the surface of graphene, and their dispersivity and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) are obviously enhanced. Studies of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry demonstrate that the as-prepared Pt/TSCuPc-graphene catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity and stability than the Pt/graphene and commercial Pt/C catalysts for methanol oxidation. It is concluded that the strategy of TSCuPc-functionalized graphene with Pt catalysts will be potential in design and synthesis of the highly efficient electrocatalysts for DMFCs applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Bi-functional catalysts are used to solve the poisoning problem caused by carbon monoxide (CO) which is the intermediate of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Flower-like vivianite (Fe3(PO4) 2•8H2O) spheres with diameter around 10 µm are originally used as supports of Pt to form bifunction catalysts. The cyclic voltammetry in 1 M H2SO4 indicates that the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt reduced on as-prepared vivianite (Pt/Vi) was 105, greater than 91 m2 g-1 for the commercial Pt/C. Besides, Pt/Vi reveals the less CO poisoning effects, including the greater mass activity in methanol oxidation and the lower onset potential in CO-stripping than Pt/C. These excellent performances on electrolyzes are related to the chemical state of Fe3+ and the coexistence of Pt0 and Pt2+ in Pt/Vi. The former activates the water and yields Fe-OHads at lower potential and the latter may offer an easy way of electron transition. Crown Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract: Titanium dioxide-ruthenium dioxide (TiO2-RuO2; TRO) powders were prepared in both the hydrous and anhydrous form using a wet chemical synthesis procedure. These materials were characterized by XRD, TEM, and BET. Their electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties such as stability under potential cycling, electrochemical surface area (ECSA), electrocatalytic activity, and fuel cell performance were measured. Anhydrous TiO2-RuO2 (TRO-a) demonstrated exceptional electrochemical stability compared to baseline Vulcan XC-72R carbon when tested using an aggressive accelerated stability test (AST) protocol. The various TRO powders were catalyzed by depositing platinum nanoparticles by an impregnation-reduction method to yield Pt/TRO electrocatalysts. The Pt/TRO-a electrocatalysts had a mass activity of 54 mA mgPt-1 and a specific activity of 284 µA cmPt-2 for the oxygen reduction reaction. Fuel cell polarization data was obtained on membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) prepared with Pt/TRO and baseline Pt/C electrocatalysts showed that the Pt-TRO-based MEAs exhibited very good performance. The performance obtained was below the Pt/C benchmark, however, further improvements in performance are expected with greater optimization of the Pt particle size and electrode structure. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Carbon supported polyhedral Pd-Pt nanocrystallines (Pd-Pt/C) are synthesized using a facile surfactant-free process. The morphology of nanocrystallines is tailored by ammonia complexation and Pd/Pt ratios of the metallic precursors. The as-prepared Pd-Pt/C catalysts with low Pt content exhibit oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, while having much higher methanol tolerance. Compared with the spherical Pd6Pt/C catalyst, the polyhedral Pd 6Pt/C catalyst shows 1.56-fold higher mass specific activity for ORR, while its electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is only half of the former. The superior ORR activity may be attributed to the more exposed regular (111) planes, the higher ratio of metallic form and the surface enrichment of Pt atoms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Platinum-deposited titanium nitride (Pt/TiN) nanoparticle aggregates with high porosities were successfully prepared via a self-assembly-assisted spray pyrolysis method. The addition of formic acid (HCOOH) had a significant influence on the process, promoting the simultaneous formation of metallic Pt and reduction on the surface of the TiN support material. Complete reduction of the Pt/TiN nanoparticle aggregates improved the catalytic activity. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt/TiN with HCOOH (Pt/TiNw/HCOOH) was 87.15 m2/g-Pt, which was higher than that of Pt/TiN without HCOOH (Pt/TiNw/o-HCOOH). The catalytic durability of Pt/TiNw/HCOOH was twice that of Pt/TiNw/o-HCOOH. An effective strategy for obtaining carbon-free catalysts with high activities and durabilities was identified. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers. (21 refs)

Abstract: We herein report a facile and effective ultrasonication method to non-covalently functionalize graphene with copper phthalocyanine-3,4',4?,4-tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (TSCuPc) as a promising catalyst support for Pt nanoparticles. With the assistance of TSCuPc, Pt nanoparticles are homogeneously deposited on the surface of graphene, and their dispersivity and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) are obviously enhanced. Studies of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry demonstrate that the as-prepared Pt/TSCuPc-graphene catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity and stability than the Pt/graphene and commercial Pt/C catalysts for methanol oxidation. It is concluded that the strategy of TSCuPc-functionalized graphene with Pt catalysts will be potential in design and synthesis of the highly efficient electrocatalysts for DMFCs applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The electro-oxidation of methanol was studied in alkaline solution on Pd nanoparticles supported on carbon black (XC-72R, C) and TiO2/C composite. The materials were prepared via organic colloid route at 170 C with 5 wt% of Pd. X-ray diffraction (XRD), PdO monolayer reduction (PdOred) and CO-stripping was employed to characterize both structure and electrochemical properties. According to this, the lattice parameter decreases from 0.3991 to 0.3905 nm due to a possible formation of Pd-Ti alloy. This modification is linked with the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) decreasing from 22 to 18 m2 g-1. On the other hand, studies as a function of temperature and alcohol concentration indicated that the current for methanol electro-oxidation is higher and more stable at Pd/TiO2-C, with Ea = 44.042 kJ mol-1. Then, it is highly possible that at Pd/TiO2-C, the OH-/OH ads couple is adsorbed at the TiO2 sites, increasing the kinetic of methanol oxidation reaction at the catalyst surface. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The price of the electrical energy produced by state of the art PEMFC is high, which hampers their full commercialization. One of the most expensive components is the catalyst material directly followed by its production method. Here we report on a high yield and relatively cheap synthesis of monodisperse platinum nanoparticles using bicontinuous microemulsion. Small nanoparticles of 2-4 nm in size have been synthesized. Process rate is controlled by the reducing agent and surfactants control the size of the resulting nanoparticles. The catalyst produced in the sodium AOT/water/heptane microemulsion showed higher durability compared to commercial catalysts. In addition, all nanoparticles produced by this procedure had a higher electrochemical surface area (ECSA) compared to commercial catalyst. Copyright © 2013 Delta Energy and Environment. (2 refs)

Abstract: A novel carbon nanostructure grown by catalytic chemical vapour deposition technique has been applied as an electrocatalyst support for oxygen reduction reaction in proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The growth of carbon nanostructure (CNS) is carried over a low cost bi-metal oxide catalyst (Fe-Sn-O) synthesized by sol-gel technique. Platinum nanoparticle decoration on Fe-Sn-O incorporated CNS (CNS-FSO) is performed by ethylene glycol reduction method. The structural as well as morphological analysis confirms the formation of CNS-FSO and platinum decoration on CNS-FSO. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of platinum decorated CNS-FSO (Pt/CNS-FSO) is 68 m2 g -1, as revealed from cyclic voltammetry. Polarization studies are carried out at different temperatures (40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C) to exploit the oxygen reduction reaction activity of Pt/CNS-FSO. A maximum power density of 449 mW cm-2 (without back pressure) at 60 °C shows the potential of this novel CNS-FSO as an electrocatalyst support in proton exchange membrane fuel cell.

Abstract: In the present study we investigated the corrosion of high surface area carbons, which are used as supports for electrocatalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Our main focus thereby was to scrutinize if Pt catalyses carbon corrosion. For this aim we employed Raman spectroscopy for studying two different carbon blacks (CBs), i.e., Vulcan XC72R (Cabot Corporation) and Ketjenblack EC-300J (AkzoNobel), both covered with Pt NPs as well as uncovered. In order to significantly degrade the CBs, we used a start/stop protocol recommended by the FCCJ (Fuel Cell Commercialization Conference of Japan) as an accelerated stress test (AST). The relative high potentials involved, i.e., 1-1.5 VRHE, inflicted a significant different electrochemical surface area loss (ECSA) of the two Pt NP covered CBs, revealing the less stable character of Vulcan XC72R as compared to Ketjenblack EC-300J. Raman spectroscopy revealed clear changes in the carbon due to potential cycling. The most significant changes were found for the Vulcan support, with two pronounced peaks above 1730 cm-1 appearing in the spectra. The peaks can be assigned to the partial oxidation of the carbon support. Interestingly, the same changes due to the AST have been found both for the Pt loaded and the bare Vulcan support. Unlike on Vulcan, on Ketjenblack no unambiguous peaks at these Raman shifts were detected after the AST, but only a small shoulder. Again no significant difference was found between the spectra of the treated bare Ketjenblack and the Pt NP covered support. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. (42 refs)

Abstract: The performance of a ten-cell 50 cm2 100 W polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack was evaluated under dynamic load cycling conditions utilizing the 2005 United States Department of Energy durability test protocol for PEFCs. An enhancement of performance was observed during the first 240 h, while an irreversible degradation of stack performance was observed after 480 h (~4700 cycles). In particular, the stack voltage at 100 mA cm-2was decreased by 2.8% after 480 h and individual cell voltage was decreased up to 8%. An analysis of cell overpotentials for activation, Ohmic, and mass transport losses revealed that the predominant source of performance degradation was due to kinetic losses. The loss of catalyst utilization was estimated to be 39% based on the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) measurements. Electron microscopic images of some of the cells showed growth in cathode Pt particle size from 5.3 to 6.2 nm. However, these microscopic images did not show any membrane damage or electrode thinning. Severe degradation of both the anode and cathode silicone gasket seals was observed during the durability test. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (33 refs)

Abstract: The accreditation systems of engineering education programs governed by the Washington Accord have evolved in order to respond to modern technological and scientific development. The principal purpose of the paper is to indicate that the process re-engineering model commonly employed in business environments can also be used in an educational system. In particular, the paper describes the process of re-engineering used for the transformation of the BEng (Mech) program in order to align it with the accreditation requirements. The study adopts a Business Re-engineering Process (BRP) in which engineering education is considered as a process. A modified McKinsey’s re-engineering model was chosen as a tool to re-engineer the educational system. The model involves five broad phases, namely, identification, review&analysis, re-design, test & implementation and continuous improvement. The paper concentrates on the first two phases. The existing curriculum is mapped according to the graduate attributes, competency profiles and the Exit Level Outcomes of the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA). From the list of identified deficiencies it can be concluded that the major shortcoming of the program is not its content but its delivery. It is recommended that innovative flexible delivery methods should be used as teaching styles. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications. (37 refs)

Abstract: The activity and the durability of Pt based electrocatalysts constitute the major challenges in the current fuel cell technology. Motivated by the improved activity and ameliorated durability for Pt based cathode catalysts achieved from the compositional and morphological control, respectively, in this paper, a rationally designed, PtCu based, 1-dimensional electrocatalyst was prepared via a facile and scalable procedure. The detailed materials characterization revealed that the as-prepared nanotubes (NTs) were composed of a PtCu alloy bulk and a Pt-enriched surface with downshifted d-band center position. Towards the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction, PtCu NTs have displayed a distinguished specific activity with more than a 10-fold improvement relative to the commercial catalysts and more than a 3-fold improvement relative to the 2015 DOE technical target (0.72 mA cmPt-2 @ 0.9 V). Meanwhile, PtCu NTs have shown greatly ameliorated durability in the aspects of both ECSA and mass activity compared to Pt/C (40%) and Pt black after a 6000-cycle accelerated durability test. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Abstract: A simple process for preparing mesoporous chromium nitride (CrN) by the ammonolysis of a bulk ternary oxide (K2Cr2O7) is reported. The products were characterized by Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. Pore sizes ranging from 10 to 20 nm are easily accessible. The conductivity of mesoporous CrN powder compressed at 35 bar is 54 S/cm. A Pt/CrN catalyst prepared from the mesoporous CrN shows a negative onset potential for methanol electrooxidation (0.20 V vs SCE) similar to that of Pt/C (0.22 V vs SCE). The electrochemically active specific surface area (ECSA) of the Pt/CrN catalyst (82 m2/g) was only slightly higher than that of Pt/C (75 m2/g). More importantly, the Pt/CrN catalyst demonstrates high tolerance to corrosion and is a candidate to replace carbon black, which is known to corrode under high potentials, as a support for fuel cell catalysts. This work provides an efficient method for preparing mesoporous metal nitrides that are promising supports for the oxidation of small organic molecules in fuel cells. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Abstract: To greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation, high-quality exfoliated graphene decorated with uniform Pt nanocrystals (NCs) (3 nm) have been prepared by a very simple, low-cost and environmentally benign process. During the entire process, no surfactant and no halide ions were involved, which not only enabled very clean surface of Pt/graphene leading to excellent conductivity, but also greatly improved the electrocatalyst tolerance to carbon monoxide poisoning (Pt/graphene, If/Ib = 1.197), compared to commercial Pt/C (If/Ib = 0.893) catalysts. To maximize the electrocatalytic performance and minimize the amount of precious Pt, Pt-M/graphene (M = Pd, Co) hybrids have also been prepared, and these hybrids have much larger electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA), which are 4 (PtPd/graphene) and 3.3 (PtCo/graphene) times those of commercial Pt/C. The PtPd/graphene and PtCo/graphene hybrids also have remarkably increased activity toward methanol oxidation (If/Ib = 1.218 and 1.558). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) simulations demonstrate that an electronic interaction occurred between Pt atoms and graphene, indicating that graphene substrate plays a crucial role in regulating the electron structure of attached Pt atom, which confirmed that the increased efficiency of methanol oxidation was due to the synergetic effects of the hybrid structure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: One great challenge in the development of portable fuel cell systems is to explore novel electrocatalysts with better performance and lower costs. Here we report a facile strategy to fabricate a ternary nanocomposite based on Pd/MnO2 nanolamella-graphene sheets (Pd/MNL/GS) and demonstrate its application as a multifunctional catalyst for both the direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) and direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The developed route rationally utilizes graphene as both a green reducing agent in the synthesis of MnO2 nanolamella and a superior supporting material for growing and supporting Pd nanoparticles (NPs). Whether for formic acid oxidation or methanol oxidation, the as-prepared Pd/MNL/GS hybrid has extremely large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) values and exhibits significantly high forward peak current densities, both of which are nearly 3 times greater than those of the Pd/GS catalyst and 6 times the Pd/Vulcan XC-72 catalyst, revealing that metal Pd can be effectively utilized in the presence of promoter components (MNL and GS). Therefore, such a ternary composite with a sophisticated 2D configuration may bring new design opportunities of high-performance energy conversion devices in the future. (97 refs)

Abstract: For polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), carbon corrosion, leading to lower activities of catalysts under cathode conditions, is one of the important technological issues to be solved. We have been developing SnO2 and Nb-SnO2 as alternative support materials. In this study, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the durability of Pt/SnO2 and Pt/Sn0.98Nb0.02O2 against voltage cycling between 1.0 and 1.5 VRHE are quantitatively investigated. Longer ORR durability was verified, compared to the standard catalyst, Pt/Vulcan. Furthermore, we have found that the degradation mechanism of ORR is probably different between carbon black and SnO2-based supports. In the case of SnO2-based catalysts, degradation arose mainly from the loss of electrochemical surface area (ECSA), while other factors were also involved for Pt/Vulcan. Consequently, SnO2 is a promising candidate electrocatalyst support material to solve carbon corrosion problems of PEFCs. © The Electrochemical Society. (9 refs)

Abstract: Alternative composite supports for platinum catalysts were synthesized from antimony doped tin dioxide (ATO) nanoparticles. In the range of the antimony content from 0 to 11mol%, the highest electrical conductivity of 1.1Scm-1 at 130°C was obtained for the 5mol% Sb ATO, from which composite supports composed of oxides and carbon and supported platinum catalysts were prepared. Using the pure oxide support, the Pt/ATO catalyst displayed superior specific activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Low surface area of ATO caused poor dispersion of Pt particles compared to composite supports, which limited the mass activity of the supported catalysts. When the ATO composites were used as supports, the Pt/C-ATO catalysts showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and durability for the ORR, attributable to the high ECSA and modified electronic structure of Pt by the ATO phase in the catalyst support. © 2013.

Abstract: We herein report a novel Pt-based electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) supported manganese oxide and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanocomposite (MnO x-PEDOT-MWCNTs) as catalyst support for Pt nanoparticles. The prepared nanocomposites are characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical tests. The results demonstrate that Pt nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the surface of MnOx-PEDOT-MWCNTs, and their dispersion and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) are obviously improved. The methanol electrooxidation activity and stability of the Pt/MnOx-PEDOT-MWCNTs are significantly enhanced as compared with the Pt/PEDOT-MWCNTs and Pt/MWCNTs catalysts. This study implies that the as-prepared Pt/MnOx-PEDOT-MWCNTs will be a promising candidate as an anode electrocatalyst in DMFCs.© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. (54 refs)

Abstract: A template-free, surfactant-free, simple electrochemical approach has been developed to prepare well-dispersed platinum (Pt) nanosheets. By simply changing the anions from SO42-to Cl-in the electrodeposition solution, the formed Pt deposits is changed from flower-like Pt particles consisting of aggregated Pt nanosheets to well-dispersed Pt nanosheets. The surface morphology and structure of the Pt particles/nanosheets were investigated by the scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The amount of the Pt loading was measured by an inductively coupled plasma method. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared Pt electrocatalysts for ammonia oxidation was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The result showed that the well-dispersed Pt nanosheets exhibits 112% and 89% increase in the mass activity(MA) for the ammonia oxidation compared with the flower-like Pt particles and commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. The much improved MA of the well-dispersed Pt nanosheets is attributed to not only the increased electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), but also the specific activity (SA). For example, the well-dispersed Pt nanosheets shows 88% increase in the SA compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (34 refs)

Abstract: Core-shell structured Co@PUC electrocatalysts containing different mass fractions of Co to Pt, which are represented as 20% (w) Co@Pt(1:1)/C and 20% (w) Co@Pt(1:3)/C, were prepared by changing the ratio of metallic precursors using a successive reduction method. The structure and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The performance of the as-prepared catalysts was compared with that of 40% (w) Co@PUC catalyst we synthesized previously. The sizes of Co@Pt(1:1) and Co@Pt(1:3) particles ranged from 2.2 to 2.3 nm, and the metal particles were well dispersed on the carbon support. The electrochemical specific area (ECSA) of 20% Co@Pt(1:1)/C (56 m2 • g-1) and 20% Co@Pt(1:3)/C (60 m2 • g-1) were higher than that of commercial 20% PUC (E-tek) (54 m2 • g-1). Compared with those of 40% Co@Pt(1:1)/C and 40% Co@Pt(1:3)/C, the half-wave potentials of 20% Co@Pt(1:1)/C and 20% Co@Pt(1:3)/C shifted to the positive direction, and they correspondingly showed improved catalytic performance. The low cost and high performance of the 20% Co@PUC catalyst make it a promising low-Pt catalyst for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. (26 refs)

Abstract: Composite nanostrucutres of TiSi2Ox coated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) were synthesized by a combination of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and magnetron sputtering processes. The synthesized nanostructures were used as supports for Pt catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange memberane fuel cells (PEMFCs). An amorphous layer of TiSi2Ox with controlled thicknesses was sputtered on NCNTs and followed by post-treatment at high temperature (1000 C, An-TiSi2Ox-NCNTs), inducing TiO2 nanoparticles of around 5 nm in diameter embedded in the amorphous layer. Further analyses via X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Ti K edge and Si K edge revealed the Ti atoms were in a TiO2 rutile environment and the Si atoms were in a SiO2 environment. Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 3 nm were deposited on the composite support, and their electrochemical behaviors toward ORR were studied. It was revealed that, even with lower electrochemical surface area (ECSA), Pt/An-TiSi2Ox-NCNTs showed better catalytic activity toward ORR than Pt/NCNT catalysts. The origin of enhanced activity of Pt/An-TiSi2Ox-NCNTs was examined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and the X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra (XANES) of the deposited Pt nanoparticles. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Abstract: Nickel-based metallic foams are commonly used in electrochemical energy storage devices (rechargeable batteries) as both current collectors and active mass support. These materials attract attention as tunable electrode materials because they are available in a range of chemical compositions, pore structures, pore sizes, and densities. This contribution presents structural, chemical, and electrochemical characterization of Ni-based metallic foams. Several materials and surface science techniques (transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), focused ion beam (FIB), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) and electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry (CV)) are used to examine the micro-, meso-, and nanoscopic structural characteristics, surface morphology, and surface-chemical composition of these materials. XPS combined with Ar-ion etching is employed to analyze the surface and near-surface chemical composition of the foams. The specific and electrochemically active surface areas (As, A ecsa) are determined using CV. Though the foams exhibit structural robustness typical of bulk materials, they have large As, in the range of 200-600 cm2 g-1. In addition, they are dual-porosity materials and possess both macro-and mesopores. © 2013 American Chemical Society. (37 refs)

Abstract: A series of Pt modified Pd/C catalysts (Pt/Pd/C) with different Pt/Pd molar ratio (Pt:Pd=1:4, 1:2 and 1:1) are synthesized by a chemical reduction method for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements confirm that Pt is deposited on the Pd nanoparticles and the Pt/Pd/C catalysts have a PdcorePtshell structure. In the half cell testing, the catalytic ORR activity of Pt1/Pd2/C and Pt1/Pd4/C are superior to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the electrochemical durability to potential cycling of Pt1/Pd2/C and Pt1/Pd1/C catalysts is better than Pt/C catalysts. The improved durability is believed to be associated with the dissolution of Pd and the corresponding structure transformation from core-shell structure to Pt-Pd alloy with Pt rich surface. The structure change is confirmed by TEM, CV, XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) loss and polarization behavior in the single cell testing also suggest that the Pt/Pd/C show a much better durability than Pt/C catalysts. Similarly, the dissolution of Pd is observed by CV and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectra (SEM-EDX). The Pt/Pd/C electrocatalysts have high ORR activity and this high activity can be further improved during potential cycling, that is, the activity and durability can be obtained simultaneously. This PdcorePtshell structure allows for the development of highly active and durable ORR electrocatalysts, with potential for the application in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). © 2012.

Abstract: The high cost of platinum electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has hindered the commercialization of fuel cells. An effective support can reduce the usage of Pt and improve the reactivity of Pt through synergistic effects. Herein, the vanadium nitride/graphitic carbon (VN/GC) nanocomposites, which act as an enhanced carrier of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) towards ORR, have been synthesized for the first time. In the synthesis, the VN/GC composite could be obtained by introducing VO3- and [Fe(CN)6]4- ions into the polyacrylic weak-acid anion-exchanged resin (PWAR) through an in-situ anion-exchanged route, followed by carbonization and a subsequent nitridation process. After loading only 10 % Pt NPs, the resulting Pt-VN/GC catalyst demonstrates a more positive onset potential (1.01 V), higher mass activity (137.2 mA mg-1), and better cyclic stability (99 % electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) retention after 2000 cycles) towards ORR than the commercial 20 % Pt/C. Importantly, the Pt-VN/GC catalyst mainly exhibits a 4 e--transfer mechanism and a low yield of peroxide species, suggesting its potential application as a low-cost and highly efficient ORR catalyst in fuel cells. Low Pt is the key! Vanadium nitride/graphitic carbon (VN/GC) composites have been synthesized by an anion-exchange route. After loading only 10 wt % Pt on VN/GC, the obtained Pt-VN/GC catalyst exhibits enhanced activity and stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (see figure). The mechanism of ORR is mainly through a four-electron pathway. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. (55 refs)

Abstract: Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) characterized by different mean diameter, BET surface area, pore volume and crystallinity were prepared and studied as supports for PtRu nanoparticles to investigate the influence of the support characteristics on the performance for the electrooxidation of alcohols. A modified microemulsion procedure was used to deposit the metal nanoparticles minimizing the effect of the support on the catalyst particle size.PtRu nanoparticles of ca. 2nm size were obtained despite the relatively low surface area of CNFs (95-185m2g-1) with a good distribution on the surface as confirmed by TEM micrographs and the high values of the electrochemically active surface areas (110-140m2g-1) determined by electrochemical CO stripping. The most appropriate PtRu dispersion was achieved for those carbon nanofibers showing the best compromise in terms of BET surface area and graphicity.A cross-analysis of the supports physico-chemical properties, ECSA and mass activity for the methanol and ethanol oxidation reactions suggests that both PtRu dispersion and electronic properties as determined by the effect of CNF crystallinity play a significant role in determining the electrocatalytic activity. Different electrocatalytic activity behavior with CNF properties were found for methanol and ethanol. Methanol oxidation is favored using highly crystalline CNFs as PtRu support, despite their low surface area, whereas ethanol oxidation is hindered by diffusional problems when using highly graphitic CNFs due to their low pore volume, so the activity is maximized supporting PtRu on CNFs with a more accessible porosity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The execution context in which pervasive systems or mobile computing run changes continuously. Hence, applications for these systems should be adapted at run-time according to the current context. In order to implement a context-aware dynamic reconfiguration service, most approaches usually require to model at design-time both the list of all possible configurations and the plans to switch among them. In this paper we present an alternative approach for the automatic run-time generation of application configurations and the reconfiguration plans. The generated configurations are optimal regarding different criteria, such as functionality or resource consumption (e.g. battery or memory). This is achieved by: (1) modelling architectural variability at design-time using Common Variability Language (CVL), and (2) using a genetic algorithm that finds at run-time nearly-optimal configurations using the information provided by the variability model. We also specify a case study and we use it to evaluate our approach, showing that it is efficient and suitable for devices with scarce resources. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (22 refs)

Abstract: The core of the design of software architecture is all about architectural decision making. A high-quality design outcome sets high requirements, not only on the skills and knowledge of the design team members, but also on the management of the decision making process. We claim that in order to deliver high quality decisions, the design team needs to obtain a high level of situational awareness. To address this, we present an analysis of the problem of team situational awareness in design workshops and propose a model on how stakeholder positions help to build consensus within the argumentation viewpoint of architectural decisions. We show how the Software Architecture Warehouse tool has been extended to support the argumentation viewpoint within its live design document metaphor to provide support for co-located and distributed design workshops. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Big Data Management has become a critical task in many application systems, which usually rely on heavyweight batch processes to process large amounts of data. However, batch architectures are not an adequate choice for the design of real-time systems, where expected response times are several orders of magnitude underneath. This paper outlines the foundations for defining an architecture able to deal with such an scenario, fulfilling the specific needs of real-time systems which expose big RDF datasets. Our proposal (Solid) is a tiered architecture which separates the complexities of Big Data management from their real-time data generation and consumption. Big semantic data are stored and indexed in a compressed way following the Rdf/Hdt proposal; while at the same time, real-time requirements are addressed using NoSQL technology. Both are efficient layers, but their approaches are quite different and their combination is not easy. Two additional layers are required to achieve an overall high performance, satisfying real-time needs, and able to work even in a mobile context. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (16 refs)

Abstract: We propose to map functional system requirements, specified with SysML, directly into system architecture, by exploiting the composition relation between component interfaces. Our research challenge is to guarantee formally that the final system fulfill the set of all requirements. Our approach is based on component-based systems (CBS) specified with SysML models and Interface Automata (IA) to capture their behaviors. From a SysML Requirement Diagram (RD), we build a Block Definition Diagram (BDD) to specify system architecture, by taking, one by one, the lowest level of requirements. At each new added requirement, we add a new component satisfying this requirement, by the composition, in the partial architecture obtained in a precedent step. Then we verify whether the new component is compatible with the components in the partial architecture, and if the requirements are preserved. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (10 refs)

Abstract: Today, architectural component models are often used as a central view of architecture descriptions. So far, however, only a very few rigorous empirical studies relating to the use of component models in architectural descriptions of software systems have been conducted. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled experiment regarding the supportive effect of architectural component diagrams for design understandability. In particular, the goal of the experiment was to determine whether architectural component diagrams, provided in addition to a non-trivial software system’s source code, have a supportive effect on the ability of novice architects to answer design and architecture related questions about that system. Our study provides initial evidence that architectural component diagrams have a supportive effect for understanding the software design and architecture, if a direct link from the component diagram’s elements to the problem that requires understanding can be made. If such a direct link cannot be made, we found evidence that it should not be assumed that architectural component diagrams help in design understanding, for instance only by providing a big picture view or some general kind of orientation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The architecture of cloud applications differs from traditional software architectures mainly regarding their basic architectural elements, the services, the metadata about the services for expressing information related to quality parameters and pricing models, and the constraints over the applications and the used services. This paper presents Cloud-ADL, a seamless extension of the ACME ADL to support the architectural representation of cloud applications by relying on the existing ACME abstractions. In addition, it defines contracts to modularly encapsulate typical contract information of cloud applications, such as quality parameters, pricing model of the services, and constraints. Finally, Cloud-ADL also supports the dynamic reconfiguration of cloud applications through programmed changes, which can be foreseen at design time and specified at the ADL level. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Software architecture erosion can reduce the quality of software systems significantly. It is hence of great importance to repair erosion efficiently, for example, by means of refactoring. However, existing refactoring approaches do not address architecture erosion holistically. In this paper, we describe the problem of optimally repairing software architecture erosion and investigate the applicability and limitations of current refactoring approaches. We argue that a heuristic search for adequate repairs using formalized and explicit knowledge of software engineers could overcome those limitations. This paper outlines an approach we have been starting to investigate in our recent research and also aims at stimulating a discussion about further research challenges in repairing software architecture erosion. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The software architecture of a system is often used to guide and constrain its implementation. While the code structure of an initial implementation is likely to conform to its intended architecture, its dynamic properties cannot be fully checked until deployment. Routine maintenance and changing requirements can also lead to a deployed system deviating from this architecture over time. Both static and dynamic checks are thus required to ensure that an implementation conforms to its prescriptive architecture throughout its lifespan. However, runtime conformance checking strategies typically alter the implementation of an application, increasing its size and affecting its performance and maintainability. In this paper, we describe the design of a novel dynamic conformance-checking framework that is pluggable and non-intrusive, thereby limiting any overheads to those periods when checking is activated. An implementation of this framework with Java as the target language and its early evaluation are also presented. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (14 refs)

Abstract: It is critical to analyze characteristics of real-time embedded systems, such as timing behavior, early in the development. In the automotive domain, EAST-ADL is a concrete example of the model-based approach for the architectural modeling of real-time systems. The Timing Augmented Description Language v2 (TADL2) allows for the specification of timing constraints on top of EAST-ADL models. In this paper we propose a formal validation & verification methodology for timing behaviors given with TADL2. The formal semantics of the timing constraints is given as a mapping to the Clock Constraint Specification Language (CCSL), a formal language that implements the MARTE Time Model. Based on such a mapping, the validation is carried out by the simulation of TADL2 specifications. The simulation allows for a rapid prototyping of TADL2 specifications. The verification is performed based on a TADL2 mapping to timed automata modeling using the Uppaal model-checker. The whole process is illustrated on a Brake-By-Wire application. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (20 refs)

Abstract: Architectural modeling using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can support the development of concurrent applications, but the problem of mapping the model to a concurrent implementation remains. This paper defines a scheme to map concurrent UML designs to a concurrent object-oriented program. Using the COMET method for the architectural design of concurrent object-oriented systems, each component and connector is annotated with a stereotype indicating its behavioral design pattern. For each of these patterns, a reference implementation is provided using SCOOP, a concurrent object-oriented programming model. Given the strong execution guarantees of the SCOOP model, which is free of data races by construction, this development method eliminates a source of intricate concurrent programming errors. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Quality attributes (QA) play a fundamental role when architecting software systems. However, in contrast to QA in traditional software systems, the role of QA when architecting service-based systems (SBS) has not yet been studied in depth. Thus, we conducted a descriptive survey to explore how QA are treated during the architecting of SBS. Data were collected using an online questionnaire targeted at participants with architecting experience. Our survey shows that QA and functional requirements of SBS are mostly considered equally important. Also, QA are usually treated explicitly rather than implicitly. Furthermore, dependability and performance appear to be the most important QA in the context of SBS. Our results partially show that general findings on QA also apply to the domain of SBS. On the other hand, we did not find a confirmation that QA are primary drivers for the architecting of SBS, or that certain application domains would focus on particular QA. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The architecture description of a software product line (SPL) is essential to make it clear how the architecture realizes the feature model and to represent both the domain and application engineering architectural artefacts. However, most architecture description languages (ADLs) for SPL have limited support regarding variability management and they do not express the relationship between features and the architecture, besides the lack of tools for graphical and textual modelling and a non-clear separation between the domain and application engineering activities. In order to overcome these deficiencies, this paper presents LightPL-ACME, an ADL whose main goal is to be a simple, lightweight language for the SPL architecture description, and enable the association between the architectural specification and the artefacts involved in the SPL development process, including the relationship with the feature model and the representation of both domain and application engineering elements. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: In the last decade, context-aware computing has become the central focus of the ubiquitous computing where computers disappear in the background of people’s everyday life activities. Context-aware adaptive systems are able to adapt themselves according to the gathered context information. In this context, many approaches have been proposed in order to model the former systems but only few of them tackle at the same time all the features of these systems. This paper presents a formal modeling approach based on Bigraphical Reactive Systems to deal with both the structural and behavioral aspects of context-aware adaptive systems. It provides a clear separation between the context-aware information that affect the system and the system itself. Indeed, we specify the context and the system using two distinct bigraphs, then we combine them using the bigraphs composition operation to represent the whole system. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The development of a single software product is inefficient when groups of product are related since the development cost could be high. In addition, some products need to be self-adaptive in order to take into account the execution context changes. In this case, the implementation and management of the adaptation mechanisms variability is challenging especially for distributed systems due to the distribution issues. We address in this paper such issues by proposing a method for the software engineering of distributed adaptation systems. We propose an architectural model for distributed management of dynamic adaptation. We define also a graph grammar based approach to automate the tasks needed to construct and configure the adaptation system. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (3 refs)

Abstract: Motivation: The current literature in the architectural knowledge domain has made a significant contribution related to documenting software architectural decisions. However, not many studies have been conducted to assess the architectural decision-making and decision reuse processes through empirical investigations. Besides, the effect of the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem on the architectural decisions-making process of each actor is not well studied. Goal: The objective of this paper is to identify the main processes and issues on the architectural decision-making in largescale enterprises by considering the relationships among the enterprises and other actors of the ecosystem. Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with six Norwegian companies in the software ecosystem of electricity industry. Results: Regarding the architectural decision-making process, the findings are in line with previous empirical studies, showing that most of the companies are not using well-known academic approaches such as ATAM, they are rather using their own procedures. The study also shows that the relationships among the actors of a software ecosystem could significantly affect the architectural-decision making process in each of the actors, for example, by limiting their alternative solutions. Finally, the results confirm that it is advantageous for the enterprises to reuse the architectural decisions across their various projects or for cooperative companies to reuse the decisions across their similar projects. Conclusion: Improving the reusable architectural decision frameworks by considering the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem would be beneficial for the industry. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Architectural prototyping is a widely used practice, concerned with taking architectural decisions through experiments with lightweight implementations. However, many architectural decisions are only taken when systems are already (partially) implemented. This is problematic in the context of architectural prototyping since experiments with full systems are complex and expensive and thus architectural learning is hindered. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for harvesting architectural prototypes from existing systems, “architectural slicing”, based on dynamic program slicing. Given a system and a slicing criterion, architectural slicing produces an architectural prototype that contains the elements in the architecture that are dependent on the elements in the slicing criterion. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Modeling SOA design patterns with a standard formal notation avoids misunderstanding by software architects and helps endow design methods with refinement approaches for mastering system architectures complexity. In this paper, we propose a formal architecture-centric approach that aims to model message-oriented SOA design patterns with the SoaML standard language. Pattern models are developed in a stepwise manner which are then automatically translated into Event-B specifications that can be proved using the Rodin theorem prover. These two steps are performed before undertaking the effective coding of a design pattern providing correct by construction solutions. Our approach is experimented through pattern examples. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (12 refs)

Abstract: Architectural patterns are important artefacts containing specialized design knowledge to build good-quality systems. Complex systems often exhibit several architectural patterns in their design which leads to the need of architectural pattern composition. Unfortunately, information about the composition of patterns tend to be vaporized right after the composition process which causes problems of traceability and reconstructability of patterns. This paper proposes a pattern description language that first, facilitates several types of pattern merging operation and second, allows the traceability of pattern composition. More specifically, the approach consists of a proper description of pattern that supports composition operations and a two-step pattern design process that helps to preserve pattern composition information. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Much research exists on architectural decisions, but little work describes architectural decisions in the real-world. In this paper, we present the results of a survey with 43 architects from industry. We study characteristics of 86 real-world architectural decisions and factors that contribute to their difficulty. Also, we compare decisions made by junior architects and senior architects. Finally, we compare good and bad architectural decisions. Survey results indicate that architectural decisions take an average time of eight working days. Dependencies between decisions and the effort required to analyze decisions are major factors that contribute to their difficulty. Compared to senior architects, junior architects spend a quarter of the time on making a decision. Good architectural decisions tend to include more decision alternatives than bad decisions. Finally, we found that 86% of architectural decisions are group decisions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (10 refs)

Abstract: Software architects are often forced to make design decisions based on limited information. In this paper, we present an approach that allows software architects to study information about design decisions made by hundreds or more software architects by automatically analyzing the version management data of large open-source repositories. The contribution is, first, that it develops a conceptual model to reason about the automatic derivation of specifically medium level architectural design decisions. Second, we show that it is indeed possible to derive these design decisions automatically from open source projects. This provides a basis for statistical and quantitative reasoning about software architecture design decisions that allows software architects to make better-informed decisions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Engineering the upcoming generation of software systems and guaranteeing the required qualities is complex due to the inherent uncertainties at design time, such as new user needs and changing availability of resources. Architecture-based self-adaptation is a promising approach to tackle these challenges. In this approach, a system maintains a model of itself and adapts itself to realize particular quality objectives using a feedback loop. Despite a vast body of work, no systematic study has been performed on the claims associated with architecture-based self-adaptation and the evidence that exists for these claims. As such insight is important for researchers and engineers, we performed a systematic literature review covering 20 leading software engineering conferences and journals in the field, resulting in 121 studies used for data collection. The review shows that self-adaptation is primarily used to improve performance, reliability, and flexibility. The tradeoffs implied by self-adaptation have not received much attention, and evidence is mainly obtained from simple examples. From the study, we derive a number of recommendations for future research in architecture-based self-adaptive systems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (18 refs)

Abstract: The amount of software in the automotive domain is steadily increasing. Existing functions are adapted or enhanced on a regular basis. Often, such adaptations do not allow to keep the interfaces of the concerned components stable, leading to incompatibilities with former systems. In this contribution, we propose an optimized adaptation software architecture to deal with mismatching interfaces. We extend existing middleware solutions with transparent adapter loading capabilities. This enables for seamless adapter integration on those systems. As adapter model we use a finite-state machine aside with a domain specific language. By extracting static adaptations from the state machine we achieve state reduction and performance gain. The approach is evaluated using an automotive case-study. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (16 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture provides a high-level design that serves as the basis for system implementation and communication among stakeholders. However, changes in requirements and lack of conformance checks during development can cause the implemented architecture to deviate from the intended one. Such architecture degradation can cause rapid software aging and high maintenance costs. Conformance checking to detect inconsistencies between a model and its corresponding implementation is one of the strategies used to minimise architecture degradation. Existing conformance checking tools often require formal architecture specifications, which are not usually available outwith academic settings, or manual intervention in the process, which affects their viability. This paper describes an automated approach that uses mappings between architecture models in UML and corresponding implementations in Java to check conformance. These notations have been chosen for their adoption in industry. A customisable tool called Card, which implements this approach, is also introduced and evaluated. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (25 refs)

Abstract: Support for capturing architectural knowledge has been identified as an important research challenge. As the basis for an approach for recovering design decisions and capturing their rationale we have performed an expert survey in practice to gain insights into the different kinds, influence factors, and sources for design decisions and also on how they are currently captured in practice. The survey has been performed with software architects, software team leads, and senior developers from six different companies in Austria with more than 10 years of experience in software development on average. The survey confirms earlier work by other authors on design decision classification and influence factors but also identifies additional kinds of decisions and influence factors not mentioned in this previous work. In addition, we gained insight into the practice of capturing, the relative importance of different decisions and influence factors, and on potential sources for recovering decisions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Software architecture has become an established discipline in industry. Nevertheless, the available documentation of architecture is often not perceived as adequate by developers. As a foundation for the improvement of methods and tools around architecture documentation, we conducted a survey with 147 industrial participants, investigating their current problems and wishes for the future. Participants from different countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America shared their experiences. This paper presents the results of the survey. The results confirmed the common belief that architecture documentation is most frequently outdated and inconsistent and backed it up with data. Further, developers perceive difficulties with a “one-size-fits-all” architecture documentation, which does not adequately provide information for their specific task and context. Developers seek for more interactive ways of working with architecture documentation that allow finding needed information more easily with extended navigation and search possibilities. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: MVC is considered an important architectural patterns when it comes to interactive applications since its invention in the days of Smalltalk. However, interaction with computers has changed. Touch-screens are as natural to users nowadays as mouse and keyboard have been for the past decades of computing and HCI-researchers keep on developing more interaction modalities. Multimodal applications pose major challenges to software engineers who have to deal with different ways for users to express the same intention. MVC does not incorporate the flexibility needed to cope with multimodal applications as it makes the controller component responsible for interaction interpretation and managing the application flow. We propose MVIC, an extension to MVC dedicated to provide a solid software architecture for multimodal, interactive applications by introducing a dedicated interaction component. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: In recent years, the software architecture community has proposed to use architectural design decisions (ADDs) for capturing the design rationale and the architectural knowledge (AK). As software systems evolve both ADDs and architectural designs need to be documented and maintained. This is a tedious and time-consuming task because of the lack of systematic and automated support for bridging between ADDs and designs. As a result, decisions and designs become inconsistent over time. We propose to alleviate this problem by introducing an AK transformation language supporting reusable AK transformations from pattern-based ADDs to component-and-connector models. In addition, we devise reusable consistency checking rules for verifying the consistency between decisions and designs. Through the use of model-driven transformations, as well as reusable, pattern-based decision models, we ensure the reusability of our approach. We apply our approach in an industrial case study and show that it offers high reusability, is largely automated and scalable, and can deal with the complexity of large numbers of recurring decisions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Reference architectures (RA) are reusable architectures for artifacts in a particular domain. They can serve as a basis for designing new architectures, but also as a means for quality control during system development. Quality control is performed through checking the conformance of systems in development to (company-wide) reference architectures. If performed manually, reference architecture conformance checking is a time- and resource-intensive process. In this paper we outline an approach for reference architecture conformance checking of application architectures in the banking domain. Reference architectures are defined on the basis of reusable rules, consisting of roles and of constraints on roles and role relationships. Conformance checking can be performed semi-automatically and continuously by automating important steps like the extraction of the actual application architecture, the binding of reference architecture roles to the elements of a specific application architecture, and the evaluation of the reference architecture rules for an application architecture. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: With demands of speed in software development it is of interest to build on available software platforms that incorporate the necessary non-competitive functionalities and focus the development effort on adding features to a competitive product. This paper proposes that we move from an API-oriented focus and instead suggest four architectural concerns for describing software platforms as more relevant. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. (6 refs)
