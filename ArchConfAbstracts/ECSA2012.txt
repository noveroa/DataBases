Abstract: Recently, software developers are faced with a fierce market competition with: diverse market needs, ever increasing number of features, and shortening product life cycle. To survive in this fierce competition, software developers are searching for methods and tools to develop various products with reduced time-to-market and improved quality. In response to these needs, we present a new CASE called VULCAN. VULCAN is a software development workbench comprising various tools for supporting the entire phases of feature-oriented product line software development from feature modeling to asset and product development. Especially, it provides several tools for supporting architecture-model-based software development where: (1) product line architectures can be specified using various architecture patterns, (2) application-specific architectures can be derived from the product line architecture specifications, (3) application-specific control components can be generated from the application rchitecture specifications, and (4) different deployment architectures can be configured with various component communication mechanisms. Of various tools included in VULCAN, we focus on this tool set for supporting architecture-model-based software development in this paper and demonstration. Copyright 2012 ACM. (15 refs)

Abstract: The concept of variability is fundamental in software product lines and a successful implementation of a product line largely depends on how well domain requirements and their variability are specified, managed, and realized. While developing an educational software product line, we identified a lack of support to specify variability in quality concerns. To address this problem we propose an approach to model variability in quality concerns, which is an extension of quality attribute scenarios. In particular, we propose domain quality attribute scenarios, which extend standard quality attribute scenarios with additional information to support specification of variability and deriving product specific scenarios. We demonstrate the approach with scenarios for robustness and upgradability requirements in the educational software product line. Copyright 2012 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: The paper presents a document template for reference architectures for the domain of software-intensive embedded systems. The template addresses the somewhat conflicting needs when documenting a reference architecture of readability, overview, details, evolution and different background of the stakeholders. The first novel idea is the template prescribes two separate documents describing a reference architecture beside the product architecture documentation. The information in the two documents concern different stakeholders and evolve at different paces. The other novelty in describing reference architectures is to introduce a perspective of time, in the form of horizons, rather than focusing on a snapshot a release date. In addition, a case is presented giving an example of how a reference architecture was documented according to the template, how stakeholder needs were captured, and how the different types of information was identified or recovered from existing product architectures.

Abstract: Modern software platforms often depend on networks of user-generated content. Although such platforms are very popular, their architectural concepts and underlying system dynamics are not yet fully understood. This paper uses stigmergy, a form of indirect communication and self-organization, as basis for framing certain groups of software services in order to propose an architectural concept of stigmergic information systems and describe identified key fields (actor base, architecture, software ecosystem) inuencing them. Thus enabling the creation of better solution stack configurations needed to support effective and efficient development of such services. Copyright 2012 ACM. (22 refs)

Abstract: Frequent itemset mining finds frequently occurring itemsets in transactional data. This is applied to diverse problems such as decision support, selective marketing, financial forecast and medical diagnosis. The cloud, computation as an utility service, allows us to crunch large mining problems. There are a number of algorithms for doing frequent itemset mining, but none are out-of-the-box suited for the cloud, requiring large data structures to be synchronized across the network. One of the best algorithms for doing frequent itemset mining is the known FP-growth (Frequent Patterns growth). We develop a cloud-enabled algorithmic variant for frequent itemset mining that scales with very little communication and computational overhead and even, with only one worker node, is faster than FP-growth. We develop the concept of a postfix path and show how this allows us to lower the communicational cost and leads to adjustable work sizes. This concept provides a very exible algorithmic solution that can be applied to a wide variety of different problem sizes and setups. Copyright 2012 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: Variability in software architectures, and especially dynamic variability in software architectures, calls for tool support. The complexity involved in the variability means that tools should be able to efficiently derive architectures at runtime. Our contribution is to offer concepts and an expository instantiation of Configurator-as-a-Service (CaaS). CaaS provides integrability, separation of derivation concerns, and automation. The approach is validated with a case of social devices, where proximity-based, distributed service compositions of mobile devices are derived at runtime. Copyright 2012 ACM. (24 refs)

Abstract: Scaling relational database in the cloud is one of the critical factors in the migration of applications to the cloud. It is important that applications can directly monitor fine-grained scaling performance (such as consistency-related replication delays and queryspecific response time) and specify application-specific policies for autonomic management of the scaling. However, there is no general mechanism and reusable framework and infrastructures to help this. The current facilities in cloud-hosted relational databases are also very limited in providing fine-grained and consumer-centric monitoring data. The situation is exacerbated by the complexity of the different underlying cloud technologies and the need to separate scaling policy from business logic. This paper presents an architecture framework to facilitate a consumer-centric, application-managed autonomic scaling of relational databases in cloud. The architecture framework includes a new consumer-centric monitoring infrastructure and customisable components for sensing, monitoring, analysing and actuation according to application-level scaling policies without modifying an existing application. We evaluated our framework using a modified Web 2.0 application benchmark. The results demonstrate the framework’s ability to provide application-level flexibility in achieving improved throughput, data freshness (different levels of consistency) and monetary saving.

Abstract: Cloud computing is being increasingly adopted in various domains for providing on-demand infrastructure and Software as a service (SaaS) by leveraging the utility computing model and virtualization technologies. One of the domains, where cloud computing is expected to gain huge traction is Global Software Development (GSD) that has emerged as a popular software development model. Despite several promised benefits, GSD is characterized by not only technical issues but also the complexities associated with its processes. One of the key challenges of GSD is to provide appropriate tools more efficiently and cost-effectively. Moreover, variations in tools available/used by different GSD team members can also pose challenges. We assert that providing Tools as a Service (TaaS) to GSD teams through a cloud-based infrastructure can be a promising solution to address the tools related challenges in GSD projects. Through an extensive review of the relevant literature on GSD and Cloud Computing, we have identified a set of quality attributes and potential architectural solutions for a cloud-based infrastructure that can provide TaaS to GSD teams. This paper outlines the promised benefits of TaaS to GSD teams, describes the expected quality attributes of a cloud-based infrastructure and how these quality attributes can be achieved. We also present a reference architecture for a cloud-based infrastructure to provide TaaS in GSD projects and describe its use with a detailed scenario of GSD projects. Copyright 2012 ACM. (35 refs)

Abstract: Variability is the ability of a software system or artifact to be adapted for specific contexts, in a preplanned manner. Many of today’s software systems are built with variability in mind, e.g., product lines and families, self-adaptive systems, open platforms, or service-based systems that support dynamic runtime composition of web services. Variability is reflected in and facilitated through the software architecture. Also, as the software architecture is a reference point for many development activities and for achieving quality attributes, variability should be treated as a first-class and cross-cutting concern in software architecture. Therefore, the Second International Workshop on Variability in Software Architecture (VARSA 2012) aims at identifying critical challenges and progressing the state-of-the-art on variability in software architecture. VARSA 2012 is a follow-up of the First International Workshop on Variability in Software Architecture (VARSA 2011), held at WICSA 2011. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). (2 refs)

Abstract: By allowing resources to be acquired on-demand and in variable amounts, cloud computing provides an appealing environment for deploying pilot projects and for performance testing of Web applications and services. However, setting up cloud environments for performance testing still requires a significant amount of manual effort. To aid performance engineers in this task, we developed a framework that integrates several common benchmarking and monitoring tools. The framework helps performance engineers to test applications under various configurations and loads. Furthermore, the framework supports dynamic server allocation based on incoming load using a response-time-aware heuristics. We validated the framework by deploying and stress-testing the MediaWiki application. An experimental evaluation was conducted aimed at comparing the response-time-aware heuristics against Amazon Auto-Scale. Copyright 2012 ACM. (13 refs)

Abstract: Within the business software domain it is crucial for a software vendor to comply to different customer requirements. Traditionally this could be done by offering different products to different customers, but because multi-tenant business software deployments use one software product to serve all customers, this is no longer possible. Software vendors have to make sure that one instance of a software product is variable enough to support all different requirements from all different customers. This ability is defined as tenant-based variability. Within this paper a conceptual model is presented, explaining the role software patterns play in solving variability implementation problems in multi-tenant business software. Different important aspects of patterns are explained, like forces and consequences and are linked to concepts in the problem domain. The paper suggests that variability patterns play a large role in addressing variability in multitenant business software and provide a valuable vocabulary for researching, reporting, thinking and communicating about variability solutions in online software products.

Abstract: The heterogeneous solutions provided by different cloud vendors have led to application interoperability and migratability issues. Companies that consume cloud services are tied to a single cloud provider due to the high costs of migrating software in the cloud. However, depending on the nature, size and interests of each company, different motivations can lead them to change their cloud provider or to have multiple providers. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem, mainly based on the adoption of standards or the use of middlewares for creating an abstraction between the software and the clouds. However neither of these approaches have yet been consolidated. In this paper an alternate approach is presented for modeling and developing cloud applications, based on MDE and software adaptation techniques. The proposed solution is both cloud vendor and user friendly as it allows the former to freely define their own cloud policies, whilst users continue to be free to choose a cloud provider, even after the application has been developed.

Abstract: The number of available cloud services has recently grown considerably. Therefore, consumers demand new methods for choosing the appropriate cloud services for their needs, whereas providers require dedicated ways to correctly elicit requirements from very heterogeneous consumers. In this poster, we present the StakeCloud community platform. This will act as a cloud resources marketplace, allowing consumers to input their needs and providing them with matching cloud services. Moreover, in case the needs are not met, they can be communicated as new requirements to cloud providers. Our solution will enable easier resource identification and requirements communication in cloud systems, thus supporting both consumers and providers Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

Abstract: Cloud Computing provides an infrastructure to utilise and share both computational and data resources whilst allowing a pay-peruse model. It is useful to cost-effectively manage hardware investment or to maximise its utilisation. Cloud Computing also offers transitory access to scalable amounts of computational resources, something that is especially important due to the time and financial constraints of many user communities. The typical use cases for public clouds involve non-business critical applications, particularly where issues around security of utilization of applications or deposited data within shared public services are binding requisites. In this poster, a use case is presented illustrating how the integration of Trusted Computing technologies into an available Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform - Eucalyptus - allows the security-critical energy industry to exploit the flexibility and potential economic benefits of Cloud Computing for their business-critical applications.

Abstract: In industry, enterprises have many software systems to be modernized and made available as added-value services. Identification of migration strategies and practices for service engineering is critical for successful legacy migration, and SOA adoption in industrial setting. This paper presents the results of an interview survey on the migration strategies in industry. The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to discover the migration strategies that industrial practice adopts 2) to identify the benefits of making such strategies explicit. Results of the survey have been analyzed in terms of migration activities and the available knowledge assets. As a result, we generalize the practice of industrial migration into a Lean & Mean SOA migration strategy. In addition, the uses of the strategy pinpoint promising industry-relevant research directions. Copyright 2012 ACM. (20 refs)

Abstract: Reference architectures refer to a special type of software architecture that achieves well-recognized understanding of specific domains, promoting reuse of design expertise and facilitating the development, standardization, and evolution of software systems. Designed for various domains and purpose, they have increasingly impacted important aspects of system development, such as productivity and quality of such systems. In another perspective, variability has been considered in several research topics as a mechanism that facilitates software development and evolution. In this context, the main contribution of this paper is to present the current status regarding variability in the reference architecture engineering. It is also presented future research perspectives that could be conducted, providing new directions to the reference architecture engineering in order to become existing and new reference architectures more effective elements to the development and evolution of software-intensive systems.

Abstract: Traditionally, governmental organizations have provided many supporting services internally. For example, incoming call switching and phone exchange services were often organized as organization-specific team of few people handling the requests. Outsourcing of similar services is a trend in many organizations. In order to minimize service disruption in an outsourcing project, a major problem is to discover the knowledge of current operations. In this paper we describe how we used formal concept analysis to extract classes of mobile subscriptions in the context of a transition project where we changed the provider of our mobile services and outsourced the incoming call switching services from in-house service to a new operator.

Abstract: When changing software systems, significant effort is spent on locating the architectural elements to be changed, how they relate to the existing and new requirements, and what decisions have led to the current state of the parts of the system to evolve. Model-based approaches have proposed formal metamodels to capture different aspects of the system, e.g. requirements specified in use cases and architectural models for the component design. Existing approaches still lack in an easy-to-use way to combine information from different models. We carried out a case study evolving the CoCoME software observing what are major points for improvement. In this paper, we discuss the results of the case study giving a list of requirements for tools or approaches supporting architecture-centric and model-based software evolution. Finally, we present our graph-based approach for integrated views which can help in overcoming some of the current limitations. Copyright 2012 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: In almost any other field than software development, the World Wide Web, or simply the Web has revolutionized collaboration by providing a platform for cooperative applications and services. In contrast, so far revision control, also referred to as version management, has been the key technology for enabling collaborative software development. However, even today it is feasible to build a cooperative development environment that runs in a cloud, following the spirit of Google Docs, where developers can cooperate in real time. In this paper, we take a step beyond from the design of the technical artifact that allows collaborative coding, and consider the consequences of such an approach to software development in a more general sense, in particular from the perspective of version management. The goal is to integrate collaborative development with traditional facilities commonly associated with software engineering. This in turn will lead to a development approach where new opportunities complement tools that are known to work and provide a lot of added value in software development Copyright 2012 ACM.

Abstract: In this position paper, we present a vision towards supporting developers to better make use of architectural abstractions by providing “just-in-time” access to architectural knowledge. The concept presented in this paper is based on two main pillars: 1. Onthe-fly access to “living” artifacts (such as code, user stories, project plans, etc.) with intelligent filtering and selection 2. Interactive presentation of architectural knowledge beyond static documentation of facts. Interactive searching, browsing and selecting relevant information in combination with intelligent decision support functions need to be installed into modern development environments which results in technical as well as social challenges. In this position paper, we sketch a vision pursuing the goal to make architectural knowledge easily accessible for every developer, especially when drowning in systemic implementation challenges.

Abstract: Cloud computing has captured the attention of both the researchers and practitioners alike. Companies and other cloud users are expecting to receive significant benefits from the new cloud based technologies. To what extent these benefits materialize for enterprise IT is not clearly understood. In this paper, we examine the perceived benefits of cloud computing from the cloud users’ perspectives. Cloud users include users of SaaS/PaaS/IaaS, ranging from end-users, to service developers and system administrators. Using content analysis techniques, weexamine one of the major discussion forums of cloud computing. Rather than offering a yes/no answer to the question posed, we offer five empirically drawn insights on the perceived benefits of cloud computing. It is proposed that the empirical insights gained are valuable to both researchers and practitioners. The value lies in a more holistic view on the promised benefits’ landscape. Copyright 2012 ACM.

Abstract: Variability is the ability of a software system to be changed for a specific context, in a preplanned manner. As such, to facilitate the instantiation of a software architecture the variability concern needs to be explicitly addressed. Usually, architectural concerns are represented using architecture views that are derived from the corresponding architecture viewpoints. Different software architecture viewpoints have been introduced to support the modeling, understanding, communication and analysis of the software architecture for different stakeholders. Regarding variability we can observe that this has been mainly addressed in separate variability modeling approaches. In this paper we first provide a short overview of the approaches for dealing with variability at the architecture design level and then introduce the variability viewpoint. The variability viewpoint addresses the concerns for variability and can be used to introduce variability in software architecture viewpoints. Copyright 2012 ACM. (12 refs)

Abstract: Service architectures continuously evolve as a consequence of frequent business and technical change cycles. Architecture change log data represents a source of evolution-centric information in terms of intent, scope and operationalisation to accommodate changing requirements in existing architecture. We investigate change logs in order to analyse operational representation of architecture change instances to discover an implicit evolution-centric knowledge that have been aggregating over time. Change instances from the log are formalised as a typed attributed graph with its node and edge attribution capturing change representation on architecture elements. We exploit graph matching as a knowledge discovery technique in order to i) analyse change operationalisation and its dependencies for ii) discovering recurrent change sequences in the log. We identify potentially reusable, usage-determined change patterns. Copyright 2012 ACM. (18 refs)

Abstract: Aiming at investigating the effect of structure on electrocatalytic properties, Pd50Ru50 nanoparticles (NPs) with three different structures were carefully designed in a one-pot polyol process for application in formic acid electrooxidation. The three structures are: (1) single-phase PdRu nanodendrites (denoted as PR-1), (2) a mixed-phase mixture of PdRu nanodendrites and monometallic Ru NPs (denoted as PR-2), and (3) a mixed-phase mixture of monometallic Pd and Ru NPs (denoted as PR-3). From PR-1 to PR-3, the structure was varied from single-phase to mixed-phase. The relative position of Ru was altered from completely Pd-connected (PR-1), to a mixture of Pd-connected and monometallic (PR-2), and completely monometallic (PR-3). All PdRu NPs outperform the commercial Pd/C. PR-2 exhibits the highest peak current density, but its stability is slightly lower than that of PR-3. When both the current density and the durability are taken into consideration, PR-2 is the best choice of catalyst for formic acid oxidation. It indicates that both the Pd-connected Ru NPs and monometallic Ru NPs in the mixed-phase PR-2 are essential to improve the electrocatalytic properties. Our study also illustrates that the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and hydrogen storage capacity of the as-prepared PdRu NPs are greatly enhanced after several hundred scans in formic acid, indicating the possibility for highly restorable catalysts in direct formic acid fuel cells.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, strong technical convergence has been observed between computing and engineering. Computing in this context includes Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology and Software Engineering. Within the traditional engineering disciplines (including Computer Engineering), academic programme accreditation is well established, but most academic computing programmes in South Africa are still unaccredited. Those that are accredited were reviewed by accreditation agencies from other countries (US, UK). The convergence between computing and engineering opened the debate and accentuated the need for accreditation within the wider computing profession in South Africa. © 2012 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: A controlled release system composed of surface modified porous polycaprolactone (PCL) membranes combined with a layer of tetraorthosilicate (TEOS)-chitosan sol-gel was reported in this study. PCL is a hydrophobic, semi-crystalline, and biodegradable polymer with a relatively slow degradation rate. The drugs chosen for release experiments were silver-sulfadiazine (AgSD) and ketoprofen which were impregnated in the TEOS-chitosan sol-gel. The surface modification was achieved by O2 plasma and the surfaces were characterized by water contact angle (WCA) measurements, atomic force microscope (AFM), scanning electron microscope and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The results showed that the release of AgSD on O2 plasma treated porous PCL membranes was prolonged when compared with the pristine sample. On the contrary, the release rate of ketoprofen revealed no significant difference on pristine and plasma treated PCL membranes. The prepared PCL membranes showed good biocompatibility for the wound dressing biomaterial applications. [All rights reserved Elsevier]. (38 refs)

Abstract: Potential cycling tests using 42.2 wt% and 19.1 wt% Pt/C catalysts were conducted by the RRDE method to evaluate the changes in the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and H2O2 formation ability of the catalysts. As the typical operating conditions of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), square wave potential cycling (0.7-0.9 V) was applied to the catalysts for 150,000 cycles in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO 4 electrolyte. During the potential cycling test, electrochemical measurements were carried out to characterize the ECSA, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and H2O2 formation. After 150,000 potential cyclings, while the ECSA of the 42.2 wt% Pt/C dropped by 35 %, the ECSA loss for the 19.1 wt% Pt/C was 55 %. This result implies that the Pt content in the cathode catalyst affects the ECSA loss during the long-term PEMFC operation. Additionally, the H2O2 formation ratio obviously increased with the potential cycling only in the case of the 19.1 wt% Pt/C. In order to verify the H2O2 formation dependence on the ECSA, four types of catalysts, which included different Pt loading amounts (42.2, 28.1, 19.1 and 9.5 wt% Pt/C), were evaluated, and these results explained the relationship between the ECSA decay and H2O2 formation increase in the durability tests. © The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: We use cyclic and rotating disk electrode voltammetry to study glycol-based coolant formulations to show that individual constituents have either negligible or significant poisoning effects on the nanoscale Pt/carbon catalysts used in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The base fluid in all these coolants is glycol (1, 3 propanediol), commercially available in a BioGlycol coolant formulation with an ethoxylated nonylphenol surfactant, and azole- and polyol-based non-ionic corrosion inhibitors. Exposure of a Pt/Vulcan carbon electrode to glycol-water or glycol-water-surfactant mixtures causes the loss of Pt electrochemical surface area (ECSA), but the Pt ECSA is fully recovered in clean electrolyte. Only mixtures with the azole corrosion inhibitor cause irreversible losses to the Pt ECSA and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The Pt ECSA and ORR activity can only be recovered to within 70% of its initial values after aggressive voltammetric cycling to 1.50 V after azole poisoning. When poisoned with a glycol mixture containing the polyol corrosion inhibitor instead, the Pt ECSA and ORR activity is completely recovered by exposure to a clean electrolyte. The results suggest that prior to incorporation in a fuel cell, voltammetric evaluation of the constituents of coolant formulations is worthwhile. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. (22 refs)

Abstract: Accelerated durability tests were carried out for a carbon-supported platinum catalyst using a rotating disk electrode at various rotation rates for various amounts of the catalyst. The loss of the normalized electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt increased with increasing the rotation rate and/or decreasing the catalyst amount. The detailed analysis showed that the reciprocal of the normalized ECSA loss rate linearly increases with the increase in ?-1/2 or the catalyst amount. By extrapolating these linear relations to zero, the ECSA loss rate at the hypothetical conditions, in which all the dissolved Pt ions would flow out to the electrolyte without re-deposition, was obtained. © The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: During proton-exchange-membrane-fuel-cell degradation various changes occur in the membrane-electrode assembly, and consequently the performance decays. Therefore, the correlation between physical property changes and the performance decay is important. In this paper, we focus on this correlation and have developed a quantitative model to estimate the performance decay after degradation. Comparison of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and polarization curves before and after potential cycling demonstrates that there was more performance decay than that estimated due only to ECSA decrease, especially at higher current densities. This large performance decay is estimated and quantitatively simulated to be due to the increase in oxygen transport resistance caused by the oxygen transport through the ionomer film coating the Pt/C particles in the cathode catalyst layer. It is shown that the data can be fit by assuming that the effective ionomer film area is proportional to ECSA. According to our results, the transport resistance increased significantly during potential cycling and more than half of the performance decay at high current densities originated from the increased transport overpotential. The effect of proton overpotential in the cathode catalyst layer was also studied with additional performance decay witnessed under low-humidity conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The effect of ppm levels of chloride ions on a carbon supported platinum catalyst was examined using an ex situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) method. The dissolution of Pt as chloride complexes and the adsorption of chloride ions resulted in a loss of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) by 4%, 7% and 13% for the respective chloride concentrations of 500 ppm, 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm. Catalyst durability was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in the presence of 1000 ppm chloride. The beginning of life (BOL) ECSA of 8.1 cm2 cm-2 was significantly reduced to an end of life (EOL) ECSA of 3.2 cm2 cm-2 after cycling in the presence of 1000 ppm chloride.

Abstract: The performance and long-term stability of a direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC) employing PtRu supported on nitrogen-modified carbon is compared with that of PtRu/C (Hi-spec 5000).

Abstract: The performance and long-term stability of a direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC) employing PtRu supported on nitrogen-modified carbon is compared with that of PtRu/C (Hi-spec 5000). The long-term stability test is carried by means of accelerated degradation testing (ADT) at an anodic potential of 0.8 V vs. DHE for 640h. The initial DMFC performance of the MEA containing PtRu/C (N- doped) is slightly lower than that of the PtRu/C (Hi-SPEC) because of the lower ECSA of the former. After 640h ADT, the anode ECSA loss is found to be 21% and 26% for the PtRu/C (N-doped) and PtRu/C (Hi-SPEC), respectively. Electrochemical analyzes reveal that cathode of the MEA with PtRu/C (N-doped) is less contaminated with Ru. It is further corroborated by post-mortem analysis done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) associated with EDS, which indicates 4.8 and 8.2 at.% Ru accumulation, respectively, in the cathodes of the PtRu/C (N-doped) and PtRu/C (Hi-SPEC) MEAs after 640h ADT. Although both MEAs sustain anode and cathode ECSA losses, the performance for the PtRu/C (N- doped) MEA is improved by 28% and 8% after initial and long-term ADT, while the performance for the PtRu/C (Hi-SPEC) MEA is improved by 20% after initial and decreased by 3% after long-term ADT.

Abstract: Open-pore nickel (Ni) foams are characterized using surface science and electrochemical techniques. A scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals interconnected Ni struts that generate small and large pores of ca. 50 and 500 µm in size, respectively. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the surface-chemical composition of the Ni foams shows that there are oxidized and metallic sections within their surfaces despite being prepared by sintering in an oxidizing atmosphere at a high temperature and being stored in moist air. The ratio of the areas of oxidized and metallic sections is evaluated using XPS data. Chemical etching of the Ni foams results in removal of the native surface oxide/hydroxide without altering the three-dimensional structure; it also increases the roughness (R) of the surfaces of Ni struts giving rise to an increase in the electrochemically active surface area (Aecsa). Thermal treatment of Ni foams in an H2(g) atmosphere at 500 °C reduces the native surface oxide/hydroxide but does not increase R or A ecsa. Electrochemical behavior of the Ni foams is examined in 0.5 M aqueous KOH solution using cyclic-voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As-received, chemically etched, thermally reduced and electro-oxidized Ni foams generate distinct CV profiles; their features are assigned to oxidized and metallic surface states. The observations made on the basis of XPS measurements are corroborated by the results of CV analyses. The application of CV and XPS or EIS allows in situ determination of A ecsa and the specific surface area (As) of the chemically etched and thermally reduced Ni foams. The values of As determined on the basis of joint CV and XPS measurements are 227 ± 74 and 149 ± 48 cm2 g-1 for the etched and reduced Ni foams, respectively. The values of As determined on the basis of CV, XPS and EIS measurements are 241 ± 80 and 160 ± 23 cm g-1 for the etched and reduced Ni foams, respectively © 2012 American Chemical Society.

Abstract: The durability of truncated octahedral Pt3Ni (t,o-Pt3Ni) electrocatalysts in the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) was investigated by using an accelerated-durability-testing procedure. The Pt3Ni/C catalyst lost 21% of its initial electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and 40% of the mass-current density (0.55 to 0.33AmgPt-1) after 30000 potential cycles under acidic conditions. In comparison, the reference commercial Pt/C catalyst lost 44% of its initial ECSA and had a final mass-specific activity of only 0.09AmgPt-1 under identical testing conditions. This study shows the potentials of this class of Pt3Ni/C nanostructures as highly active and durable ORR catalysts. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim. (47 refs)

Abstract: Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst supported by hybrid composite materials is prepared by well-mixing carbon black (CB) with Pt-loaded reduced graphene oxide (RGO). With the insertion of CB particles between RGO sheets, stacking of RGO can be effectively prevented, promoting diffusion of oxygen molecules through the RGO sheets and enhancing the ORR electrocatalytic activity. The accelerated durability test (ADT) demonstrates that the hybrid supporting material can dramatically enhance the durability of the catalyst and retain the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt: the final ECSA of the Pt nanocrystal on the hybrid support after 20 000 ADT cycles is retained at >95%, much higher than the commercially available catalyst. We suggest that the unique 2D profile of the RGO functions as a barrier, preventing leaching of Pt into the electrolyte, and the CB in the vicinity acts as active sites to recapture/renucleate the dissolved Pt species. We furthermore demonstrate that the working mechanism can be applied to the commercial Pt/C product to greatly enhance its durability. © 2012 American Chemical Society. (40 refs)

Abstract: Carbon nanofibers (CNF) characterized by different mean diameter, BET surface area and graphicity were prepared and used as supports to enhance Pt dispersion in low temperature fuel cell catalyst. As a comparison, a conventional Pt on carbon black (Vulcan XC72R) catalyst was prepared using the same procedure. The most appropriate Pt dispersion was achieved for the carbon nanofiber support showing the best compromise in terms of BET surface area and graphicity. This catalyst shows enhanced electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with respect to the Pt/Vulcan catalyst. A cross-analysis of the supports physical-chemical properties, ECSA and mass activity for the ORR suggests that both Pt dispersion and electronic properties as determined by the effect of surface groups and graphicity play a significant role in determining the electrocatalytic activity. Whereas, regarding the decay associated to the corrosion in accelerated degradation tests (ADT), two mitigation effects are envisaged, anchoring effect of surface groups stabilizes Pt nanoparticles with respect to dissolution, whereas a high surface graphicity index reduces carbon corrosion which acts as support for the Pt particles. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..

Abstract: Dealloying of Pt bimetallic nanoparticles is a promising synthesis method to prepare highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline and acidic PEM fuel cells. We present here a structural, compositional and electrochemical characterization linked with ORR activity for carbon supported PtCu3, PtCu, and Pt3Cu alloy nanoparticles in different electrolytes and pH values. The effects of electrolyte and pH are systematically examined on the ECSA and Pt mass based activity (j mass) for various Pt-Cu alloys. We observed the formation of Cu oxide species and redissolutionredeposition of Cu species during the voltage cycling up to 1.0 V/RHE in 0.1 M KOH. In contrast, the voltage cycling in 0.1 M HClO4 immediately causes the dissolution of Cu and results in Pt-enriched particle surface. We have correlated the ECSA and mass activity with the as-synthesized composition in dependence on both electrolytes. In summary, after voltage cycling in 0.1 M HClO4 the values of jmass increase according: Pt3Cu 3. However, after voltage cycling in 0.1 M KOH the values of jmass increase in the following trend: PtCu3 3Cu. Only after activation process, PtCu3 core-shell catalyst shows significantly enhanced ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH compared to pure Pt. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society. (82 refs)

Abstract: XC-72 carbon blacks were steam-etched for different lengths of time and were then used as catalyst supports for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that the central parts of the XC-72 carbon black samples were more easily etched away. X-ray diffraction results show that the 0 0 2 and 1 0 peaks were initially sharp, but then broadened during the corrosion process, indicating that more graphitic components are in the steam etched carbon blacks. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the steam-etched carbon black samples remained above 60% after running for 45 h corrosion test, while for the pristine carbon black samples, the ECSA dropped down to below 50%. Both the polarization curve results and the TEM micrographs of the catalysts after corrosion show that the corrosion resistance increased significantly in the steam-etched samples. These results indicate that steam etching is a simple and efficient method to increase corrosion resistance for PEFC catalysts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (42 refs)

Abstract: Carbon-supported Pd and Pd3M (M = Fe, Ni, Cu) electrocatalysts were synthesized by the co-precipitation method and subsequently annealed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 °C. X-ray diffraction patterns of the Pd alloys revealed a major diffraction peak shift to higher diffraction angles, indicating alloy formation. The crystallite sizes of the electrocatalysts were significantly altered at higher annealing temperatures, especially at 600 and 800 °C. The change in electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) with annealing temperature was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. Pd 3Fe/C annealed at 800 °C showed 3-fold higher ECSA compared to Pd annealed at same temperature. A comparison of the kinetic currents for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) obtained on the various Pd3M alloys revealed higher ORR activity for Pd3Fe/C (60 mA/mgPd) and Pd3Cu/C (42 mA/mgPd) annealed at temperatures of 800 °C and 600 °C respectively, when compared with pure Pd (33 mA/mg Pd) and other variants. Koutecky´-Levich plots for Pd 3Fe/C and Pd3Cu/C indicated that the four-electron transfer pathway for oxygen reduction was followed in these alloys. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Supported chemically ordered Pt-Fe intermetallic compounds have been prepared through a straightforward two-stage approach. By taking advantage of this straightforward two-stage synthesis, we have for the first time successfully obtained supported Pt3Fe1 and Pt 1Fe1 intermetallic nanoparticles with a mean size of less than 5 nm, a narrow size distribution and good dispersion. The nanoparticles of supported intermetallic Pt3Fe1 and Pt1Fe 1 compounds showed superior electrocatalytic activities towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The ORR enhancement in supported electrocatalysts made from Pt-Fe intermetallic compounds may be attributed to their geometric and electronic structure. Accelerated durability tests (ADT) show that Pt3Fe1/C has better durability, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) values of commercial Pt/C decreased by 49% after 5000 cycles, but Pt1Fe1/C showed a reduction in the ECSA value of 3% after 5000 cycles.

Abstract: We synthesized Pt catalysts supported on titanium nitride nanoparticles (Pt/TiN, Pt loading, 8.9 wt%) by a colloidal method. The Pt nanoparticles were found to exhibit a characteristic hexahedral shape with clear faceting, with a lattice structure that was highly oriented to that of the TiN support, indicating a strong interaction between the Pt nanoparticles and the TiN support. We evaluated the electrochemical activity of the Pt/TiN both without and with mixing with electronically conducting acetylene black (AB), the latter denoted as Pt/TiN + AB. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Pt in Pt/TiN + AB was noticeably larger than that of Pt/TiN, reaching 108 m 2g(Pt)-1 as a maximum, which was close to the geometrically estimated Pt surface area (127 m2 g(Pt) -1), based on transmission electron microscopy. By means of a potential step cycling test (0.9-1.3 V vs. RHE) simulating start/stop cycles in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), it was found that both of the TiN-based catalysts exhibited superior durability compared to commercial Pt catalysts supported on carbon black (Pt/CB) or graphitized carbon (Pt/GCB), based on the ECSA values. The mass activities at 0.85 V of both of the TiN-based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were also higher than those for commercial Pt/CB or Pt/GCB during the potential step cycling test. The superiority of the TiN catalysts must have arisen as a result of the stabilization of the Pt nanoparticles due to their strong interaction and well matched crystallographic structures, as well as the complete elimination of nanopores from the support surfaces. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the cold-start operation of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) through high-resolution neutron radiography, experimental testing, theoretical evaluation, and comparison with model prediction. Ice formation location, voltage evolution, and loss of the electro-catalyst surface area (ECSA) are examined. A dimensionless parameter , characterizing the spatial variation of the reaction rate across the cathode catalyst layer, is discussed at subfreezing temperature using newly determined membrane ionic conductivity. The evaluation identifies the operating range that the reaction rate can be treated uniform across the catalyst layer, in which the model is valid. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Carbon-supported Pt/PdCo and Pt/Au/PdCo catalysts with a low Pt loading were prepared by a combined underpotential deposition and galvanic replacement route. The X-ray diffraction results show that after annealing in H 2/Ar atmosphere, the alloy degree of PdCo is enhanced. The average metal particle size of PdCo/C, PdCo/C-H, Pt/PdCo/C and Pt/Au/PdCo/C, characterized by transmission electron microscopy, is about 2.6, 4.1, 5.3 and 5.5 nm, respectively. The electrochemical characterizations show that the Pt/PdCo/C electrocatalyst exhibits a high activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but is unstable in electrochemical environment. After the accelerated aging tests (AAT), the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for the Pt/PdCo/C catalyst decreases by 48% and the half-wave potential of the ORR polarization curve (E1/2) shifts 35 mV negatively. After decorated by Au, both the catalytic activity and stability of the Pt/PdCo/C catalyst are improved significantly. Compared to Pt/PdCo/C, the E1/2 for Pt/Au/PdCo/C shifts 22 mV toward higher potentials. After the AAT, the ECSA decreases only 26%, and the E1/2 shifts 13 mV negatively for Pt/Au/PdCo/C. The enhanced catalytic activity and stability should be due to the high resistance to be oxidized for Pt and the suppressed OH adsorption on the Au-decorated Pt surface. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: Design activity is core to modern engineering practice. Some design experience is demanded by professional bodies that accredit degree engineering programmes (e.g. ABET and ECSA). The purpose of this paper is to track design related topics through the curriculum of the mechanical engineering degree programme at the University of Botswana. A questionnaire was designed and administered to staff teaching on the programme. The responses were used to map design components in the curriculum and assess the design experience of students. The results showed that design topics were delivered in various courses and the knowledge gained by students increased steadily from Year 3 to Year 5. Some observed deficiencies in the teaching of design included lack of industry recommended projects, negligible application of design software, and the use of only single discipline based problems (i.e. no multi disciplinary teaching approach). It was concluded that a programme review is needed to improve the pedagogy of design and enhance programme robustness. It is envisaged that the study will help in designing a new mechanical engineering curriculum to satisfy accreditation requirements. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland. (13 refs)

Abstract: We report the enhanced activity and stability of CuPt bimetallic tubular electrocatalysts through potential cycling in acidic electrolyte. A series of CuPt tubular electrocatalysts with sequential increased lattice ordering and surface atomic fraction of Pt were designed and synthesized by thermal annealing to reveal their improved electrocatalytic properties. These low-Pt-content electrocatalysts with Pt shell are formed through the thermal annealing and following potential cycling treatment. The catalysts (C1) with a low atomic fraction of Pt on the surface and low lattice ordering in the bulk are treated in acidic electrolyte, resulting in the formation of a Pt shell with relatively low activity and stability. However, the catalysts (C2) with a Pt-rich surface and high lattice ordering have a highly enhanced electrochemical surface area after potential cycling via surface roughing. The rough Pt shell of the C2 catalysts is achieved by leaching of surface Cu and the concomitant morphology restructuring. The C2 Pt surface demonstrated highly improved specific and mass activities of 0.8 mA cmPt-2 and 0.232 A mg Pt-1 at 0.9 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and after 10 000 cycles, the C2 catalysts display almost no loss of the initial electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). Meanwhile, the stability of these CuPt catalysts shows regular change. Moreover, after a long-term stability measurement, the ECSA of C2 catalysts can be restored to the initial value after another potential cycling treatment, and thus, this kind of electrocatalyst may be developed as next-generation restorable cathode fuel cell catalysts. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

Abstract: Vertically aligned chromium nanorod arrays were grown on glassy carbon electrodes by a dc magnetron sputtering glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. The Cr nanorods were used as low-cost, high surface area, metallic supports for a conformal Pt thin film, resulting in a potential low-loading electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Conformal coatings of Pt on Cr nanorods were achieved using a dc magnetron sputtering small angle deposition (SAD) technique. The electrocatalytic ORR activity of SAD-PtGLAD-Cr electrodes was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and rotating-disk electrode techniques in a 0.1 M HClO 4+d solution at temperatures ranging from 20 to 60°C, and was compared to those of GLAD Cr nanorods coated with Pt thin film deposited at normal and large angles of incidence. The results show that SAD-PtGLAD-Cr nanorods exhibit higher values of electrochemically-active surface area (ECSA), area- and mass-specific activities, and better stability against loss of ECSA during potential cycling in the acidic electrolyte. The improved ORR activity and enhanced catalyst utilization of SAD-PtGLAD-Cr electrode might be attributed to a better Pt conformality, especially at the sidewalls of the nanorods, and a preferential exposure of certain crystal facets. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: Accurate detection of lip contour is important in many application areas, including biometric authentication, human computer interaction, and facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a new lip boundary localization scheme based on Game Theory (GT) to improve the facial expression detection performance. In addition, we use GT for selecting the proper set of facial features. We apply the Extended Contribution-Selection Algorithm (ECSA) for the dimensionality reduction of the facial features using a coalitional GT-based framework. We have conducted several sets of experiments to evaluate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach has achieved recognition rates of 93.1% and 92.7% on the JAFFE and CK+ datasets, respectively. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. (15 refs)

Abstract: Single-cell and half-cell degradation test procedures are evaluated for carbon supported Pt catalysts. Half-cell analyses are employed in identification of specific test parameters for evaluation of cathode catalysts. Single-cell measurements run at 100 % relative humidity (RH) evaluate the impact of catalysts degradation on fuel cell performance. The measurements in both setups show a 20 % deviation of the electrochemical surface area loss (ECSA), while the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity losses were comparable. The quantification of specific degradation mechanism as Pt dissolution and particle agglomeration in correlation with surface area and oxygen reduction activity is discussed. © The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract: Ir-decorated PdCu alloy catalyst on carbon support (Ir-PdCu/C) is prepared via two-step procedure, which consists of polyol process for PdCu alloy nanoparticle supported on carbon support followed by surface replacement reaction step by Ir ions. The structure of nanoparticles is characterized by ICP-AES, XRD, and TEM-EDX. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of Ir-PdCu/C catalyst are larger and higher than those of PdCu/C catalyst, respectively. Furthermore, Ir-PdCu/C catalysts showed a higher single cell performance as a cathode catalyst for high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. High electrocatalytic activities of Ir-PdCu/C catalyst could be attributed to electronic and structural modification of PdCu alloy by decoration of Ir atom selectively on the surface of PdCu alloy nanoparticle supported on carbon support, which results in PdIr alloy outer region and PdCu alloy inner region. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: The graphene supported Pt nanoparticles are prepared by ethylene glycol reduction method. The obtained Pt/graphene (Pt/G) nanocomposites are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TEM images show that the spherical Pt nanoparticles with sizes of 3.1 nm disperse uniformly on the surface of the graphene, which is consistent with the XRD date of 2.97 nm. The Pt/G nanocomposites show electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 62.7 m 2/g. It has been found by electrochemical measurements (i.e., cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry) that the Pt/G nanocomposites exhibit good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward borohydride oxidation. Besides, the Pt/G nanocomposites are used as anode electrocatalyst in a direct borohydride fuel cell at 298 K, and the maximum power density is 42 mW/cm 2, which is apparently higher than Vulcan XC-72R supported Pt (Pt/C) nanoparticles (34 mW/cm2).

Abstract: A novel alternated catalyst layer structure (ACLS) has been developed for fuel cell applications. Sputtering process was applied directly on commercial gas diffusion layer (GDL) by depositing catalyst-forming material and pore-forming material alternately in a nanometer-scale and then removing the pore-forming material. The main physical features of the ACLS are (1) carbon-free and support-free (2) a large amount of void layers/pores, (3) sheet-like catalyst with extended surface and compressed lattice, and (4) a large amount of crystalline planes parallel to catalyst sheet surface. Such characteristics make the ACLS a promising candidate for the PEM cathode application. In this report, some basic evaluation results of the ACLS cathode are presented. Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) evaluations showed that the typical ACLS exhibited a value of 15~30 m2/g and had a high Pt utilization efficiency. For oxygen reduction reaction activity (ORR), the measurement on 5 cm2 fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies showed that an ACLS with 5 nm-thick Pt sheets could increase mass activity 1.5 times and specific activity 3.5 times compared to the commercial Pt/C. Cathode potential at high current densities was evaluated by H2/O2 single-cell test. An ACLS with a Pt loading of 0.07 mg/cm2 demonstrated performance comparable to that of a commercial Pt/C with 0.2 mg/cm2 Pt loading. Excellent durability of the ACLS was also confirmed. © The Electrochemical Society. (7 refs)

Abstract: We synthesize Pt, Pd, Au and layered multimaterial nanotubes via electrodeposition in anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) templates. We show that time controlled growth at constant electrolyte concentration allows the morphology and chemistry of the nanostructure to be controlled to a high degree. In particular the wall thickness of the nanotubes can be tuned from thin wall nanotubes to nanorods. The applications targeted are electrocatalysis, plasmon resonance and molecular detection via surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The electro-oxidation of methanol on Pt and that of formic acid on Pd are investigated and compared with state of the art Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts and some of the recent similar work from the literature. Nanotubes of both metals (Pt, Pd) show very high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Our electrocatalysis results show great promise towards direct liquid fuel cells. In terms of molecular detection using SERS we show that the SERS activity of Au-nanostructures is strongly dependent on morphology with very high SERS enhancements being related to partly filled Au-nanotubes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

Abstract: We investigated influences of SO2 concentration and relative humidity in fuel and air streams on anode and cathode poisoning behaviors under open circuit voltage and load operating conditions in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The rate of cell voltage degradation increased with the increase in SO2 concentration and the normalized cell voltage drop curves were consistent with each other. Cell voltage at equilibrium with SO2 supply was inversely proportional to the concentration of supplied SO2, suggesting that adsorption of sulfur species on the catalyst was in equilibrium and was determined by the SO2 concentration in the electrode. Relative humidity significantly impacted electrode contamination. Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed pronounced anode contamination under lower RH conditions and suppressed contamination under high RH conditions. Fuel cell load operation showed mitigated anode poisoning, suggesting that appropriate water management of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) mitigates electrode contamination. © 2012 by JSME.

Abstract: Nanorod arrays of platinum were fabricated on flat (Sample A) and patterned glassy carbon electrodes at room temperature using glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. Pt nanorod arrays were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating-disk electrode (RDE) techniques as a potential polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell cathode electrode for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Patterned substrates with honeycomb geometry were obtained utilizing modified-nanosphere lithography method using polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles of diameters 250 (Sample B) and 500 (Sample C) nm. The RDE results demonstrate that samples B and C have higher diffusion limiting current density values of 5.8 and 6 mA/cm2 at potential range of 0.2-0.7 V compared to 5.6 mA/cm2 for sample A. ORR polarization curves show that the specific-area activity (SA), normalized to the Pt ECSA, of sample A at 0.9 V is about 1,060 µA/cm2 that is about 18.7% higher than for the nanorods of sample B and C with SA of 893 µA/cm2. However, samples B and C exhibit significantly higher specific-area activities at lower potentials, for example at 0.75 V, SA = 41,773 and 95,870 µA/cm2, respectively, which are 2.8 and 6.5 times higher than 14,693 µA/cm2 of sample A. The higher ORR activity at low potential region in the polarization curve of periodic and well-separated GLAD Pt nanorods is attributed to the enhanced electrode porosity which facilitates the oxygen mass transport to the active catalyst sites.

Abstract: Sn-modified platinum catalysts are presently one of the most active catalysts for the room temperature electrooxidation of ethanol at low potentials. In this study, Pt-SnOx/C catalysts are prepared by the polyol method in different ethylene glycol-water mixtures using a Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 3 in the preparation solution. When the water content in the synthesis is very low (2 vol.%), only a limited amount of Sn can be incorporated into the catalyst (Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 91:9). Increasing the water content in the synthesis increases the Sn content and the intrinsic activity for ethanol electrooxidation by the “bifunctional catalysis” mechanism; however, water content in excess of 50 vol.% is counterproductive since there is a corresponding growth in the catalyst particle size which results in a reduction of the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Experimentally a 50:50 (vol./vol.) mixture of ethylene glycol and water is the most effective since all the precursor metals in the preparation solution can be completely transferred to the target catalyst. The advantages are not only limited to composition control (concordance of catalyst composition and solution composition in preparation), but also a small particle size (~2.2 nm) and the highest mass activity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Pt-Co alloy nanoparticles have emerged as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in hydrogen fuel cells. Our study presents a comprehensive structural, compositional and electrochemical characterization linked with ORR activity for carbon supported PtCo3, PtCo, and Pt3Co alloy nanoparticle catalysts in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M KOH. Surface-sensitive cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the changes of composition of outermost atomic layers of Pt-Co alloys. Our electrochemical results in alkaline media clearly show the stability and voltage-induced accumulation of Co on the particle surface, whereas in 0.1 M HClO4 the voltage cycling initiates the rapid dissolution of Co to form a Pt-enriched surface surrounding by alloy core. We correlated the ECSA and ORR activity with the as-synthesized chemical composition of Pt-Co alloys. In results, after electrochemical treatment in 0.1 M HClO4 the Pt mass based activities (jmass) increase according: Pt(HT) 3Co 3 at comparable particle size. Unlike to acid, after voltage cycling in 0.1 M KOH jmass increase according: PtCo3 3Co. However, in 0.1 M KOH activated PtCo3 core-shell catalyst shows 4-5 fold higher mass activity compared to pure Pt and Pt(HT). © 2012 The Electrochemical Society. (97 refs)

Abstract: The Ir-V/C catalyst was successfully synthesized by EG method as novel, suitable cathode catalyst for PEMFCs. The XRD showed that the interatomic Ir-Ir distances in the Ir-V/C catalyst were decreased, which can result in more facile O2 adsorption and reduction due to the modified surface and electronic properties. EDS and ICP-MS results indicated that the catalyst contained negligible V content, indicating a beneficial dealloying effect resulting from HCl addition during catalyst synthesis. With a loading of 0.4 mgIr cm-2 Ir-V/C, it achieved a maximum power density of 517.2 mW cm-2, which is higher than the maximum power density of 367.2 mW cm-2 obtained for pure Ir/C. In-situ CV results indicated that the loss of the transition metal effectively improved the overall ECSA of Ir-V/C and particle surface roughness of Ir. This provides a higher density of active sites that can adsorb and subsequently reduce oxygen molecules during fuel cell operation. © The Electrochemical Society. (10 refs)

Abstract: Well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles supported on low-defect graphene (LDG) sheets are successfully prepared by a soft chemical method. Our approach can efficiently avoid damaging the graphene framework in the composite because it does not require cumbersome oxidation of graphite in advance and needs no subsequent reduction of the LDG sheets due to the lower oxidation degree. Morphology observations show that the Pd nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 1 to 5 nm are evenly deposited on graphene sheets. Raman spectroscopic analysis results reveals that there is only a very small amount of graphene defects in the hybrid. No matter whether it is for a direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) or direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), the LDG-supported Pd catalyst has very large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) values, more than twice as large as that for the reduced graphene oxide, or five times the commercial XC-72 carbon. The forward peak current measurements show similar results. The excellent catalytic performance of LDG/Pd can be attributed to the preserved pristine graphene structure, which not only provides a lot of surface area for the deposition of nanoparticles, but also allows for electrical conductivity and stability in the composite. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Abstract: Poor long-term performance and durability combined with high production and maintenance costs remain the main obstacles for the commercialization of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). While on-line diagnosis and operating condition optimization play an important role in addressing the durability issue of the fuel cell, health-monitoring and prognosis (or PHM) techniques are of equally great significance in terms of scheduling condition-based maintenance (CBM) to minimize repair and maintenance costs, the associated operational disruptions, and also the risk of unscheduled downtime for the fuel cell systems. In this paper, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) approach is proposed for the purpose of damage tracking and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of a PEMFC. To implement this model-based PHM framework, a physics-based, prognostic-oriented catalyst degradation model is developed to characterize the fuel cell damage that establishes the relationship between the operating conditions and the degradation rate of the electro-chemical surface area (ECSA). The model complexity is kept minimal for on-line prognostic purpose. Simulation is carried out for validation of the proposed algorithm, using a more detailed catalyst degradation model. (21 refs)

Abstract: Both (Ni, Pt) and bimetallic (NixPt; x = 1, 2, 3) nanoparticles have been synthesized by hydrogenation of Ni(cod)2 ad Pt 2(dba)3 in the presence of a weak coordinating ligand, hexadecylamine (CH3(CH2)15NH2, HDA). These nanostructures were characterized by different techniques (Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)), and were evaluated as Hydrogen Evolution Reaction electrocatalysts in 0.5 M sulfuric acid. The effects of varying the platinum amount during the synthesis were systematically studied by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), polarization measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. HRTEM shows that the bimetallic nanostructures display a different morphology compared to that observed for pure Ni and Pt ones. The process of hydrogen adsorption-desorption in the as-prepared electrodes seems to occur in (110) and (100) facets. It was found that the increase in the activity for the HER is due to an increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and/or stabilization in the case of elemental electrode materials; and to the effect of Pt amount in the case of the Ni-Pt nanostructures (synergistic effect leads to lower overpotential). It has been established that the main pathway for the HER is Volmer-Heyrovsky. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (68 refs)

Abstract: A novel particle-on-alloy nanomaterial has been designed and successfully synthesized for oxygen reduction (ORR) with high activity and long-term stability, in which well-isolated Pt nanoparticles are supported by amorphous NiCo nanoalloys. The Pt-on-NiCo nanostructures are prepared through the artificial active collodion membrane by one-step method, and experimental data reveals that Pt is isolated and spreads onto the amorphous NiCo nanosupport, and not only Pt but also Ni and Co are metallic in the Pt-on-NiCo nanostructures. The optimized Pt53-on-NiCo nanostructures show higher activities in both the onset potential and kinetic current density toward the ORR relative to the commercial Pt reference catalysts because the Pt-on-NiCo catalyst could lower the OHad, which is considered to inhibit the ORR toward water. Meanwhile, Pt-on-NiCo nanostructures exhibit relatively long-term stability with only ~8% loss in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for Pt. (32 refs)

Abstract: Nanorod arrays of chromium (Cr) were grown on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes by a dc magnetron sputtering glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. The Cr nanorods were used as low-cost, high surface area, metallic supports for a conformai layer of Pt thin film catalyst, as a potential low-loading electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. A dc magnetron sputtering small angle deposition (SAD) technique was utilized for a conformai coating of Pt on Cr nanorods. The ORR activity of SAD-Pt/GLAD-Cr electrodes was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating-disk electrode (RDE) techniques in a 0.1 M HClO4 solution at room temperature. A reference sample consisting of GLAD Cr nanorods coated with a Pt thin film deposited at normal incidence (? = 0°) was prepared and compared with the SAD-Pt/GLAD-Cr nanorods. Compared to GLAD Cr nanorods coated with Pt thin film at ? = 0°, the SAD-Pt/GLAD-Cr nanorod electrode exhibited higher ECSA and area-specific and mass-specific ORR activity. These results indicate that the growth of catalyst layer on the base-metal nanorods by the SAD technique provides a more conformai and possibly a nanostructured coating, significantly enhancing the catalyst utilization. © 2012 Materials Research Society.

Abstract: In the domain of dynamically evolving distributed systems composed of autonomous and (self-) adaptive components, the task of systematically managing the design complexity of their communication and composition is a pressing issue. This stems from the dynamic nature of such systems, where components and their bindings may appear and disappear without anticipation. To address this challenge, we propose employing separation of concerns via a mechanism of dynamic implicit bindings with implicit communication. This way, we strive for dynamically formed, implicitly interacting groups - ensembles - of autonomous components. In this context, we introduce the DEECo component model, where such bindings, as well as the associated communication, are managed in an automated way, enabling transparent handling of the dynamic changes in the system. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: We describe a research program on design techniques to enable the cost-effective construction of trustworthy systems. The focus is on single-machine systems that can be formally verified to provide desired system-wide security and safety properties. Such systems are designed as compositions of small trusted components and large untrusted components whose behaviour is constrained by an underlying formally verified OS kernel. Past work has shown that building these systems is possible, now we wish to do so in a cost effective way. A key part of doing this is to design, as early as possible, an architecture that can provide the required trustworthiness properties. The research program envisions methods, models, analyses, and patterns to create and formally analyse such architectures. We present initial work on this program and discuss the gaps and research questions that will shape future research. © 2012 IEEE. (12 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we present industrial experiences made by combining two polarizing disciplines in software engineering: software architecture and agile software development. In particular, we show how architectural design decisions could be made, communicated, and sustained in an agile development environment by using a light-weight component framework. The concepts of the component framework have proven to be effective in addressing challenges such as connecting architectural design decisions to a system’s implementation and making the architecture tangible for the developers. This is of utmost importance when the software is delivered in accordance with agile principles, such as “working software over comprehensive documentation” or “responding to change over following a plan”. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Traceability analysis is used to improve quality in the software development process. As such an analysis is complex to implement and often requires a lot of dense code that is specific to the system being traced, there is a need for a framework to express traceability analysis tasks. This paper presents the Traceability Query Language TracQL, an expressive, extensible, representation-independent, and fast domain-specific language. Known approaches do not fulfill all these requirements. We examine TracQL and compare it to other approaches on a software ageing problem, namely to detect divergence between architecture and code. The necessary TracQL code is much shorter (by a factor of 1.7) and about twice as fast as what known approaches can achieve. © 2012 IEEE. (21 refs)

Abstract: In enterprises using service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural information is used for various activities including analysis, design, governance, and quality assurance. Architectural information is created, stored and maintained in various locations like enterprise architecture management tools, design tools, text documents, and service registries/repositories. Capturing and maintaining this information manually is time-intensive, expensive and error-prone. To address this problem we present an approach for automatically extracting architectural information from an actual SOA implementation. The extracted information represents the currently implemented architecture and can be used as the basis for quality assurance tasks and, through synchronization, for keeping architectural information consistent in various other tools and locations. The presented approach has been developed for a SOA in the banking domain. Aside from presenting the main drivers for the approach and the approach itself, we report on experiences in applying the approach to different applications in this domain. © 2012 IEEE. (16 refs)

Abstract: Embedded systems typically operate in resource-constrained environments and often find themselves in difficult to access locations, making system maintenance expensive and the management of quality difficult to achieve. The service-oriented model of deployment offers a potential solution to these challenges as it allows for software systems to be dynamically composed and reconfigured using services discoverable at runtime. However, the resource contention between services on the orchestration platform can cause significant falls in Quality of Service (QoS). This emergent QoS is difficult to anticipate before deployment as changes in QoS are often dynamic and influenced by many factors. This paper presents EQoSystem, a resource-aware architecture combining resource monitoring with dynamic workflow management and service orchestration. We demonstrate the efficacy of EQoSystem using a medium-sized case study deployed on an embedded platform. The results show that continuous and effective resource management changes can be made to maintain resource consumption within preset thresholds. © 2012 IEEE. (25 refs)

Abstract: In component-based software engineering, software architectures govern not only software development but also software evolution. Indeed, to efficiently and accurately manage software evolution and guarantee its quality, architecture models should be at the core of the evolution process, be accurately synchronized with the runtime systems and have their changes and version information be completely tracked. As architecture models are often captured by ADLs (Architecture Description Languages), an ADL supporting architecture-centric evolution is required. In this paper, we study how architecture-centric evolution can be supported by the Dedal ADL. We thus propose a dedicated CDL (Change Description Language) which models architectural changes as first-class entities and describes them from a semantic viewpoint. © 2012 IEEE. (25 refs)

Abstract: A central aspect of architecting is architecture description. Architecture descriptions take many forms and serve many purposes throughout the life cycle of development, operation and maintenance activities. The use of multiple views - diverse representations for distinct audiences and uses - has been a major tenet of architecture description since the earliest work in software architecture. This tenet has been codified in various ways. Most practising software architects must operate within the confines of a prescribed architecture framework (AF) or architecture description language (ADL) as dictated by their organization or client. Current AFs and ADLs are defined with varying degrees of rigour and offer varying levels of tool support, furthermore, these resources are often closed, making it difficult for the architect to tailor a representational solution to the specific challenges of the project at hand. In this paper we propose an automated infrastructure to support the architecture description-related activities of the architect. This infrastructure facilitates customization, composition and reuse of the architect’s representational resources (AFs, ADLs and their constituents) to meet project-, domain- and organization-specific needs. The proposed approach builds upon the conceptual foundations of ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for architecture description. The approach has been evaluated in the context of a complex, real-world, public transportation system. © 2012 IEEE. (32 refs)

Abstract: Managing the cost-effective evolution of industrial software systems is a challenging task because of their complexity and long lifetimes. Limited pro-active evolution planning and software architecture erosion often lead to huge maintenance costs in such systems. However, formerly researched approaches for evolution scenario analysis and architecture enforcement are only reluctantly applied by practitioners due to their perceived overhead and high costs. We have applied several recent sustainability evaluation and improvement approaches in a case study to the software architecture of a large industrial software system currently under development at ABB. We combined our selection of approaches in a lightweight method called MORPHOSIS, for which this paper presents experiences and lessons learned. We found that reasonable sustainability evaluation and improvement is possible already with limited efforts. © 2012 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: Decentralized systems are systems-of-systems whose services are governed by two or more separate organizations under distinct spheres of authority. Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any\  one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services. COAST combines mechanisms from software architecture, cryptography, security, and programming languages, granting application architects flexible provisioning of their core services and assets while protecting those services and assets from attack and misuse. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Architectural recovery techniques analyze a software system’s implementation-level artifacts to suggest its likely architecture. However, different techniques will often suggest different architectures for the same system, making it difficult to interpret these results and determine the best technique without significant human intervention. Researchers have tried to assess the quality of recovery techniques by comparing their results with authoritative recoveries: meticulous, labor-intensive recoveries of existing well-known systems in which one or more engineers is integrally involved. However, these engineers are usually not a system’s original architects or even developers. This carries the risk that the authoritative recoveries may miss domain-, application-, and system context-specific information. To deal with this problem, we propose a framework comprising a set of principles and a process for recovering a system’s ground-truth architecture. The proposed recovery process ensures the accuracy of the obtained architecture by involving a given system’s architect or engineer in a limited, but critical fashion. The application of our work has the potential to establish a set of “ground truths” for assessing existing and new architectural recovery techniques. We illustrate the framework on a case study involving Apache Hadoop. © 2012 IEEE. (14 refs)

Abstract: One of the approaches for documenting software architecture is to treat it as a set of architectural design decisions. Such decisions are always made in the context of requirements that must be fulfilled and in the context of decisions that were made before. Currently, models for representing architectural decisions are mainly concentrated on showing the decision making process of the initial architectural design. However, decisions that have been made in such a process may need to be changed during further evolution and maintenance of the software architecture, typically in response to the new or changed requirements. A graphical modelling notation for documenting architectural decisions (Maps of Architectural Decisions) has been developed by our team. In this paper, it is presented how this notation could be used to model architectural decisions under changing requirements. It is proposed how one decision change could be effectively propagated through the rest of the architectural decision model and how a rigorous and tool-supported process of updating such models could be organized. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Practices designed to expedite the delivery of stakeholder value can paradoxically lead to unexpected rework costs that ultimately degrade the flow of value over time. This is especially observable when features are developed based on immediate value, while dependencies that may slow down future development efforts are neglected. The technical debt metaphor conceptualizes this tradeoff between short-term and long-term value: taking shortcuts to optimize the delivery of features in the short term incurs debt, analogous to financial debt, that must be paid off later to optimize long-term success. In this paper, we describe taking an architecture-focused and measurement-based approach to develop a metric that assists in strategically managing technical debt. Such an approach can be used to optimize the cost of development over time while continuing to deliver value to the customer. We demonstrate our approach by describing its application to an ongoing system development effort. © 2012 IEEE. (31 refs)

Abstract: We propose a novel approach that merges implied scenarios and race condition analysis techniques, to systematically detect and analyse security-related vulnerabilities at the architectural level. We apply our approach to an industrial case related to architecting systems interfacing the cloud. The application demonstrates an effective use of the approach, where the approach has detected securityrelated vulnerabilities in the architecture due to unexpected modes of interactions in such environment. Our approach was able to guide testers to detect critical security scenarios, which were not perceived during the inception phases or not captured using either of implied scenarios or race conditions detection techniques alone. We reflect on its applicability and scalability. We look into possible usage scenarios related to architectural-level testing for security and incremental refinements of the architecture following the detection of security vulnerabilities. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Product line engineering is an approach that works well for managing the anticipated variability of software systems as demonstrated in numerous studies. However, little empirical research and few approaches exist for dealing with the unanticipated evolution of product lines. As a result, the understanding of product line evolution is still weak and the maturity of approaches and tools supporting evolution is often insufficient. In this paper we present results of a case study on impact analyses and desired tool support in product line evolution. Our findings are based on observing 30 person months of development. We analyzed changes made to a product line in typical evolution scenarios by involving the key developers. We used empirical data on observed development activities and impact analyses to derive a trace information model showing frequently desired trace links. We discuss lessons learned and implications for tool developers. © 2012 IEEE. (46 refs)

Abstract: Business and design decisions regarding software development should be based on data, not opinions among developers, domain experts or managers. The company running the most and fastest experiments among the customer base against the lowest cost per experiment outcompetes others by having the data to engineer products with outstanding qualities such as power consumption and user experience. Innovation experiment systems for mass-produced devices with embedded software is an evolution of current R&D practices, going from where innovations are internally evaluated by the original equipment manufacturer to where they are tried by real users in a scale relevant to the full customer base. The turnaround time from developing and deploying an embedded product to getting customer feedback is decreased to weeks, the limit being the speed of the software development teams. The paper presents an embedded architecture for realising such a novel innovation experiment system based on a set of scenarios of what to evaluate in the experiments. A case is presented implementing an architecture in a prototype in-vehicle infotainment system where comparative testing between two software alternatives was performed. © 2012 IEEE. (9 refs)

Abstract: A common approach to software architecture documentation in industry projects is the use of file-based documents. This approach offers a single-dimensional perspective on the architectural knowledge contained. Knowledge retrieval from file-based architecture documentation is efficient if the perspective chosen fits the needs of the readers, it is less so if the perspective does not match the needs of the readers. In this paper we describe an approach aimed at addressing architecture documentation retrieval issues. We have employed a software ontology in a semantic wiki optimized for architecture documentation. We have evaluated this ontology-based approach in a controlled industry experiment involving software professionals. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is found to be better than that of the file-based approach. © 2012 IEEE. (29 refs)

Abstract: Many of today’s enterprise software systems are subject to variability. For example, enterprise software systems often run in different business units of an organization, with each unit having its own detailed requirements. Systematic handling of variability allows a software system to be adjusted for different contexts, by planning for adaptation during architecture design. As variability is system-wide, it is reflected in the software architecture. To facilitate the representation and analysis of variability in the architecture of enterprise software systems, we propose an architecture viewpoint. To define a reusable variability viewpoint, we elicited stakeholders and concerns through exploratory studies. We also show how the viewpoint was applied for describing variability in a large-scale e-government system. © 2012 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: As the software for avionics becomes more complex, the challenge to provide the required reliability and safety mechanisms becomes also more complex. Embracing the ARINC 650 and 653 standards to provide a means to embark several systems into a single hardware cabinet opens the door to the development of even more elaborated software avionics systems, by overcoming the space constraints once found in this kind of system. Nevertheless, ARINC 653 exhibits also some limitations regarding fault redundancy management, especially when handling redundant applications with spares that back up other applications. In this paper, a framework to support fault tolerance and reconfiguration in avionics systems under the umbrella of ARINC 653 standard is described. This paper represents part of the results of the research projects carried out during the last two years by Eurocopter Espana in collaboration with the University of Castilla-La Mancha. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Formal modelling techniques are often disregarded as their semantics are too distant from the mainstream practice of software architecture design, which is dominated by the use of component based modelling and patterns. This paper advocates the need for formal modelling techniques for humans, i.e., software architects who need to precisely ascertain the security properties of their design models. We contribute a technique that enables architects to more easily construct verified, secure architecture designs by assembling already verified security pattern models. Our approach is illustrated with a pattern language for accountability. It is validated by an observational study that shows that the approach produces reusable results, and is able to uncover relevant architectural security flaws. © 2012 IEEE. (15 refs)

Abstract: Software product line engineering aims at increasing software quality and development productivity by mastering the variability of large software systems. Models are frequently used to define the reusable assets and the restrictions regarding asset composition in different products. However, product line engineering is challenged by evolution. Reusable assets such as software components need to be adapted to meet new customer or market requirements as well as technological needs. In this paper we present an approach that supports the maintenance of product line models by checking their consistency with the available components. We describe algorithms and heuristics for creating and updating the models defining a product line’s features and components. We evaluate our approach using realistic change scenarios from a product line of time recorder applications. © 2012 IEEE. (29 refs)

Abstract: Offering services in the internet requires a dependable operation of the underlying software systems with guaranteed quality of service. The workload of such systems typically significantly varies throughout a day and thus leads to changing resource utilisations. Existing system monitoring tools often use fixed threshold values to determine if a system is in an unexpected state. Especially in low load situations, deviations from the system’s expected behaviour are detected too late if fixed value thresholds (leveled for peak loads) are used. In this paper, we present our approach of a workload-aware performance monitoring process based on performance prediction techniques. This approach allows early detections of performance problems before they become critical. We applied our approach to the e-mail system operated by Germany’s largest e-mail provider, the 1&1 Internet AG. This case study demonstrates the applicability of our approach and shows its accuracy in the predicted resource utilisation with an error of mostly less than 10%. © 2012 IEEE. (23 refs)

Abstract: Documenting and maintaining the traceability between architectural models and code is one of the foremost challenges of model-based software development. Yet, traceability is rarely captured immediately while models and code co-evolve but usually recovered later. By then key people may have moved on or their recollection of facts may be blurred or inconsistent. In previous work, we proposed a language for capturing traceability that allows for uncertainty and incompleteness. This paper investigates this language on the unique properties that characterize model-to-code traceability. Our approach takes ambiguous, incomplete, and possibly incorrect assumptions about the traceability between model and code as input. It then validates the correctness of these assumptions and completes the input by inserting their logical consequences. This paper demonstrates the correctness and scalability of our approach which has been validated on several third-party software systems. Our approach is automated and fully tool supported. © 2012 IEEE. (38 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture has been proven as a conceptual tool to manage the development and evolution of a software product. However, integrating architecting as an activity in software engineering is still perceived as a major challenge in practice. Our observation from many projects centered around architecture is that most organizations actually fail to plan architecting activities and align them in product development. The consequence is that the value of the architecture is underrated and the power of architecture remains more often than not unexploited. In this paper, we introduce the notion of architecture engagement purpose - an auxiliary construct to align architecting with other engineering activities in the product lifecycle. We gained first promising results in applying it in industrial projects, where explicit architecture engagement purposes enabled the organization in planning and tracking architecting as an activity within their software engineering. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) concisely express the essential features of system designs. However, using a DSL for automated analysis and code generation requires developing specialized tools. We describe how to create model analysis and code generation tools that can be applied to a large family of DSLs, and show how we created the LIGHT platform, a suite of such tools for the family of software architecture-based DSLs. These tools can be easily reused off-the-shelf with new DSLs, freeing engineers from having to custom-develop them. The key innovation underlying our strategy is to enhance DSL metamodels with additional semantics, and then automatically synthesize configurations and plug-ins for flexible analysis and code generation frameworks. Our evaluation shows that, for a DSL of typical size, using our strategy relieves software engineers of developing approximately 17,500 lines of code, which amounts to several person-months of programming work. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Software designers frequentlynd the need to refactor existing code to improve the structure of their design. Typical examples include the application of design patterns or splitting large modules into smaller ones. The problem lies in the difficulty in evaluating the effect of such restructuring before developers implement their newly proposed design ideas. Such experimental implementation can be expensive because it may include potential con icts or cause unnecessary source code branching to occur. It can be even more expensive if the designer needs to compare multiple design alternatives. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate the possibility of simulating structural design changes based on Baldwin and Clark’s modular operators. This simulation permits designers to explore the design space and validate ideas for software changes without having to implement them concretely. © 2012 IEEE. (9 refs)

Abstract: Reference architectures have emerged as a special type of software architecture that achieves well-recognized understanding of specific domains, promoting reuse of design expertise and facilitating the development, standardization, and evolution of software systems. Designed for various domains and purpose, they have increasingly impacted important aspects of system development, such as productivity and quality of such systems. However, reference architectures have been sometimes established without an adequate concern about which elements they should encompass. Besides that, there is a lack of work that investigate the essence of reference architectures, their dimensions and elements that they should contain. In this perspective, the main contribution of this paper is to present a reference model for reference architectures, named RAModel (Reference Architecture Model), that intends to improve the understanding about what reference architectures are, as well as their components and relationships, supporting the establishment, use, and evolution of such architectures. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Currently, gamification is a new trend under which all activities are subsumed that try to introduce game mechanics into non-gaming applications in order to increase user engagement, motivation, and participation. This approach is especially promising in the enterprise domain since enterprise information systems (EIS) mainly focus on efficiency aspects rather than individual long-term motivation and enjoyment. Prior research has shown that these latter variables lead to higher positive organizational outcomes, e.g., job performance. Additionally, first vendors have successfully implemented platforms for gamification. However, these platforms are designed for business-toconsumer (B2C) purposes, require high integration effort and lead to silo-based applications. Requirements for EIS strongly differ from consumer web or desktop applications. Hence, we present a generic platform for enterprise gamification. We derive an architecture for gamification systematically from serviceoriented and event-driven principles and best practices. Based on this architecture, we identify important research challenges for subsequent work. Ultimately, we validate the architecture’s feasibility in a prototypical implementation. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: In scenario-based requirement elicitation techniques such as quality attribute scenario elicitation and use case engineering, the requirements engineer is typically forced to make some implicit early architectural assumptions. These architectural assumptions represent initial architectural elements such as supposed building blocks of the envisaged system. Such implicitly specified assumptions are prone to ambiguity, vagueness, duplication, and contradiction. Furthermore, they are typically scattered across and tangled within the different scenario-based requirements. This lack of modularity hinders navigability of the requirement body as a whole. This paper discusses the need to explicitly document otherwise implicit architectural assumptions. Such an explicit intermediary between quality attribute scenarios and use cases enables the derivation and exploration of interrelations between these different requirements. This is essential to lower the mental effort required to navigate these models and facilitates a number of essential activities in the early development phases such as the selection of candidate drivers in attribute-driven design, architectural trade-off analysis and architectural change impact analysis. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: The demographics of the western world is changing: people are getting older and as a partial consequence get an increasing number of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary disease. At the same time, healthcare systems are stressed for resources, health centers are getting larger and more distributed, and the number of healthcare professionals does not follow the trend in chronic diseases. All of this leads to a need for telemedical and mobile health applications. In a Danish context, these applications are often developed through local (innovative) initiatives with little regards for national and global (standardization) initiatives. A reason for this discrepancy is that the software architecture for national (and global) systems and standards are hard to understand, hard to develop systems based on, and hard to deploy. To counter this, we propose a software ecosystem approach for telemedicine applications, providing a framework, Net4Care, encapsulating national/global design decisions with respect to standardization while allowing for local innovation. This paper presents an analysis of existing systems, of requirements for a software ecosystem for telemedicine, and a summary of initial design decisions for the Net4Care framework. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Quantitative assessment of quality attributes (i.e., non-functional requirements, such as performance, safety or reliability) of software architectures during design supports important early decisions and validates the quality requirements established by the stakeholder. In current practice, these quality requirements are most often manually checked, which is time-consuming and error-prone due to the overwhelmingly complex designs. We propose an automated approach to assess the reliability of software architectures. It consists in extracting a Markov model from the system specification written in an Architecture Description Language (ADL). Our approach translates the specified architecture to a high-level probabilistic model-checking language, supporting system validation and quantitative reliability prediction against usage profile, component arrangement and architectural styles. We validate our approach by applying it to different architectural styles and comparing those with two different quantitative reliability assessment methods presented in the literature: the composite and the hierarchical methods. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Agreement on Non-Functional Requirements between customer and supplier is crucial to a successful IT solution delivery project. In an ideal world, stakeholders and architects cooperate to achieve their common goals in a win-win situation. In a commercial setting, however, one dominant feature often introduces powerful forces from outside the technical realm. That feature is the customer/supplier relationship, usually formalized in bidding rules or as a delivery contract. Formal customer/supplier relationships often place severe limitations on information exchange between stakeholders and architects. In this paper, we explore the effect of such limitations on the interaction of architectural design with the quantification of Non-Functional Requirements, and explore a number of avenues to deal with them. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: When using Software Architecture documents (ADs), users typically “forage” for information. However, it is little understood how they do this foraging or how to structure architecture documentation to assist them. We conducted a survey of two different groups of foragers, industry practitioner and academic AD users, to investigate issues - types of forages, foraging sequences and styles - related to task-based architectural information foraging in software architecture documents. Our results show that there were different pre-conceived ideas of what to forage for prior to the search, but during foraging there was commonly foraged information. The different groups of foragers place different emphasis on information related to quality requirements, purpose of the system, use cases, physical view and process view. Foraging sequences starting with certain information were suggested to better support understanding of the described SA. These sequences typically followed the written order of the information as dictated by the AD producers. This reinforces the critical responsibility of AD producers to structure the architectural information for understanding. Diagrams, views and design decisions were most frequently cited as supporting understanding of the SA. The main hindrance was too much text and a lack of diagrams. © 2012 IEEE. (18 refs)

Abstract: Software component identification is one of the primary challenges in component base software engineering. Typically, the identification is done by analyzing existing software artefacts. Considering object-oriented systems, many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue by identifying a component as a high cohesive and loose coupled set of classes. However, this assumption leads to two main limitations: in one hand, the focus on simple metrics like high cohesion and loose coupling will not necessarily lead to good quality components. The need of high level quality characteristics for components is crucial. On the other hand, the identified components’ external structure (provided and required interfaces) is missing. As a result, the identified components can hardly be reused, composed, packaged and documented. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper an approach for identifying components based on a fitness function to measure the quality of a component. To evaluate this function, we use quality and semantic correctness models. Also, we propose to identify the provided and required interfaces of a component. © 2012 IEEE. (16 refs)

Abstract: Nowadays the software architecture of a system is often seen as a set of design decisions providing the rationale for the system design. When designing a software architecture multiple levels of design decisions need to be considered. For example, the service-based integration of heterogeneous platforms and the development of applications on top of those integration services requires high-level as well as technology-, domain-, and application-dependent architectural decisions. In this context, we performed a series of qualitative studies following a multi-method approach. First, we conducted a systematic literature review from which we derived a pattern language for platform integration featuring 40 patterns, as well as a pattern-based architectural decision model. Then, we performed interviews with 9 platform experts from 3 companies for revising the architectural knowledge captured by the pattern language and the decision model. Finally, we participated in a case study and observed the decision-making process to validate the results further. Our observations resulted in 1) a qualitatively validated, pattern-based architectural decision model and 2) a generalized model of the different levels and stages of architectural decision making for service-based platform integration. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Although enterprises perceive the importance of change, practitioners often report that dealing with changes is still a challenge. One way of addressing change is to guide the decision making of architects using a viewpoint. This paper presents a change viewpoint that frames the concerns of architects related to change. In an attempt to better understand what the architects’ concerns are and the kind of support they need for dealing with change, we have conducted a case study in the Dutch Electronic Health Record system. Based on the results of this case study, the change viewpoint, aiming at guiding the architects in their reasoning, has been defined and discussed. © 2012 IEEE. (13 refs)

Abstract: Big data phenomenon refers to the practice of collection and processing of very large data sets and associated systems and algorithms used to analyze these massive datasets. Architectures for big data usually range across multiple machines and clusters, and they commonly consist of multiple special purpose sub-systems. Coupled with the knowledge discovery process, big data movement offers many unique opportunities for organizations to benefit (with respect to new insights, business optimizations, etc.). However, due to the difficulty of analyzing such large datasets, big data presents unique systems engineering and architectural challenges. In this paper, we present three system design principles that can inform organizations on effective analytic and data collection processes, system organization, and data dissemination practices. The principles presented derive from our own research and development experiences with big data problems from various federal agencies, and we illustrate each principle with our own experiences and recommendations. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Approaches for sharing and reusing architectural knowledge (AK) have found some application in practice. Capturing AK during software design and development, however, is still a problem. Main reasons are the effort involved in capturing, as well as lack of time and budget, and lack of short-term benefits for the involved stakeholders. We propose using context information about currently modified artifacts, like time, existing relations, and user information, for automatically identifying and presenting relevant AK. The main aim is to simplify the use of AK during development by presenting a continuously updated context-relevant view on AK for currently viewed artifacts. This facilitates capturing and maintaining of relations among knowledge entities, updating existing entities, and finding relevant entities during architecture analysis and reviews. In this paper we present the main concepts of our approach, report on first experiences, and discuss future work. © 2012 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: Handheld mobile technology can help disaster relief workers and soldiers in the field with tasks such as speech and image recognition, natural language processing, decision-making, and mission planning. However, these applications are computation-intensive, take a heavy toll on battery power, and often rely on good connectivity to networks, limiting their practical usefulness in a crisis. This paper presents a reference architecture for mobile devices that overcomes these limitations by exploiting cloudlets - VM-based code offload elements that are in single-hop proximity to mobile devices. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Architecture Description Languages usually specify software architectures in the levels of types and instances. Components instantiate component types by parameterization and type conformance. Behavioral analysis of dynamic architectures needs to deal with the uncertainty of actual configurations of components, even if the type-level architectural descriptions are explicitly provided. This paper addresses this verification difficulty for connector-based architecture styles, in which all communication channels of a system are between components and a connector. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) We propose a process-algebraic model, in which the main architectural concepts (such as component type and component conformance) and several fundamental architectural properties (i.e.~deadlock-freedom, non-starvation, conservation, and completeness) are formulated. (2) We demonstrate that the state space of verification of these properties can be reduced from the entire universe of possible configurations to specific configurations that are fixed according to the type-level architectural descriptions. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: While the performance analysis of a software architecture is a quite well-assessed task nowadays, the issue of interpreting the performance results for providing feedback to software architects is still very critical. This is mostly due to the gap between results representation (i.e. mean values, variances, and/or probability distributions) and expected feedback (i.e. architectural alternatives). Performance antipatterns represent effective instruments to tackle this issue, because they document common mistakes leading to performance problems as well as their solutions. In this paper we present a model-driven approach that enables performance antipatterns to arise in the context of an ADL-based software architecture. Such approach automatically detects them in AEmilia, i.e. an ADL allowing the performance evaluation of software systems. The approach has been applied to a case study, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. © 2012 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: During the architecture development process, architectural design decisions play an important role in maintaining non-functional properties of the system. Instead of supposing that architectural decisions are implicitly recognizable, existing works propose to give them first-class status. However, little focus is paid on the automation of architectural decision checking. This paper proposes to leverage pattern formalization techniques to document architectural decisions. The approach consists of a way to describe architectural patterns that hold the architectural decision definition, show how to integrate architectural decisions (patterns) into an architectural model and finally automate the architectural decision conformance checking. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: In this paper, the notion of forces as influences upon architecture decisions is introduced. To facilitate the documentation of forces as a part of architecture descriptions, we specify a decision forces viewpoint, which extends our existing framework for architecture decisions, following the conventions of the international architecture description standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. The applicability of the viewpoint was validated in three case studies, in which senior software engineering students used it to document decisions in software projects, two of which conducted for industrial customers. The results show that the forces viewpoint is a well-received documentation approach, satisfying stakeholder concerns related to traceability between decision forces and architecture decisions. © 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Effective variability support has become an important attribute of modern software development practices. Organizations show an increasing interest in the development of software applications using software platforms, reusable components, and mass customization. Even though many variability management tools exist, an approach that integrates support for variability management (e.g. features, decisions, variation points, and variants) directly into architecture models is still missing. Making variability concepts an integral part of architecture models has many benefits. Variability management and architecture development can be integrated into one consistent information model and development environment supporting full traceability of architectural artifacts (e.g. requirements, features, components) on all levels of the development lifecycle. In this paper we show how we integrated orthogonal variability modeling and feature modeling into LISA, an approach and toolkit for architecture management and analysis. Variability management is no longer a separate activity but an integral part of the architecture development lifecycle. © 2012 IEEE. (22 refs)

Abstract: An organisation that had developed a large Information System wanted to embark on a programme of significant evolution for the system. As a precursor to this, it was decided to create a comprehensive architectural description. This undertaking faced a number of challenges, including a low general awareness of software modelling and software architecture practices. The approach taken for this project included the definition of a simple, specific, architecture description language. This paper describes the experiences of the project and the ADL created as part of it. © 2012 IEEE. (15 refs)

Abstract: This paper describes an implementation of the Infrastructure-as-a- Service (IaaS) concept for scientific computing and seven service pilot implementations with requirements from biomedical use cases at the CSC - IT Center for Science. The key service design requirements were enabling the use of any scientific software environment the use cases needed to succeed, and delivering the distributed infrastructure ICT resources seamlessly with the local ICT resources for the scientist users. The service concept targets the IT administrators at research organisations and delivers virtualised compute cluster and storage capacity via private network solutions. The virtualised resources can become part of the local cluster as virtual nodes and they can share the same file system as the physical nodes assuming the network performance is sufficient. Extension of the local resources can then be made transparent to enable an easy infrastructure uptake to the scientist end-users. Based on 20 months of service piloting most of the biomedical organisations express a sustained and growing need for the distributed compute and storage resources delivered with the IaaS. We conclude that a successful implementation of the IaaS can improve access and reduce the effort to run expensive ICT infrastructure needed for biomedical research Copyright 2012 ACM. (16 refs)
