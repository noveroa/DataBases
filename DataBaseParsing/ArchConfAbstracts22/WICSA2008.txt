Abstract: Conventional data networks are based on layered architectures. The introduction of wireless networks has created a need to violate this layering discipline to create crosslayer designs or adaptations. Ad-hoc implementations of such cross-layer adaptations reduce the level of modularity and abstraction in the network�s implementation, giving rise to a significant increase in complexity. We present a taxonomy of possible cross-layer adaptations that is then used to derive an architecture for their implementation that significantly preserves the networks structure. We present implementation results that validate this architecture in the context of a real wireless network implementation. � 2008 IEEE. (11 refs)

Abstract: An analysis of the current practice for representing architectural views reveals that they focus mainly on functional concerns and are limited when considering quality concerns. We introduce the recovery style for modeling the structure of the system related to the recovery concern. The recovery style is a specialization of the module viewtype in the Views & Beyond approach. It is used to communicate and analyze architectural design decisions and to support detailed design with respect to recovery. We illustrate the style for modeling the recovery views for the open-source software, MPlayer. � 2008 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: Evolution is a permanent challenge in product line engineering. Reusable assets such as software components or documents evolve continuously due to new customer requirements or technology changes. This leads to modifications or extensions of the product line�s variability models describing the reference architecture. Due to the large size of product lines, single stakeholders or teams can only maintain a small part of a system which poses additional challenges for evolution. This paper presents a tool-supported approach for building and maintaining variability models of large-scale product lines. We structure variability models into multiple model fragments of manageable size that can be created and maintained by individual teams. Model fragments can be merged semiautomatically into a variability model. We illustrate the approach with examples from ongoing industry collaboration. � 2008 IEEE. (14 refs)

Abstract: Architecture patterns are an important tool in architectural design. However, while many architecture patterns have been identified, there is little in-depth understanding of their actual use in software architectures. For instance, there is no overview of how many patterns are used per system or which patterns are the most common or most important for particular domains. In addition, little is known of how architecture patterns ay interact with each other. We studied architecture documentation of 47 systems to learn about their architecture patterns. Most systems had two or more architecture patterns, and certain patterns were prominent in different application domains. We identified several patterns that are commonly used together, and are beginning to learn how such combinations may impact system quality attributes. This information can be used to help designers select architecture patterns, can help people learn both architectures and patterns, and can be useful in architectural reviews. � 2008 IEEE. (28 refs)

Abstract: Software architecting is a highly knowledge-intensive process demanding and producing a large and rich amount of information. To remain competitive, companies and organizations working in the IT sector must be able to manage this knowledge portfolio and effectively exploit and reuse it. In the era of Web 2.0, knowledge grids, social networking, global development and semantic web, this working session addresses the problem of building a knowledge community in the field of software architecture. To this end, we aim at exploring the wishes of academics and industrial organizations, on the one hand, and their boundaries on he other. Our goal is to compare and contrast the inputs from academia and industry, and gain a shared understanding about what can be done now, and in the near future. � 2008 IEEE. (14 refs)

Abstract: Architecture-based software development is the implementation of a software system in terms of its architectural constructs (e.g., components, connectors, ports). It has been shown as an effective approach to realizing and managing the architecture of large scale software systems. Several techniques and tools have been developed that are intended to aid with the architecture-based development of software systems. While these approaches provide adequate implementation support for some aspects of software architectures, they often lack sufficient support for implementing and enforcing the system�s software architectural style. In this paper, we argue that the lack of sufficient support for architectural styles is a by-product of its crosscutting structure. In turn, making it impossible to realize styles using the object-oriented programming methodology. We propose a new approach to implementing architectural styles that is based on the aspect-oriented programming paradigm. � 2008 IEEE. (9 refs)

Abstract: The right software architecture is critical to achieving essential quality attributes, but these qualities are only realized if the program as implemented conforms to its intended architecture. Previous techniques for enforcing architecture are either unsound or place significant limitations on either architectural design or on implementation techniques. This paper presents the first system to statically enforce complete structural conformance between a rich, dynamic architectural description and object-oriented implementation code. We extend previous work to (1) explain what full structural conformance means in an object-oriented setting, and (2) enforce architectural structure in the presence of shared data. We show that the resulting system can express and enforce important structural constraints of an architecture, while still supporting key object-oriented implementation techniques. As a result of our conformance property, developers can be assured that their intended architecture is realized in code, so the system will exhibit the desired quality attributes. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: Drawing on a case study that adequately represents a mediumsize component-based distributed architecture, the contribution of this paper shows how existing performance repositories could be mined to value the ranges in which a given software architecture can scale to support likely changes in load. The mining is based on a financial analogy, where we utilize the concept of twin asset in financial engineering to justify mining relevant repositories. The mining process in then complemented with real options analysis for predicting the values resulted from the ranges in which an architecture can scale under uncertainty, where uncertainty is attributed to the unpredicted change in load. As the exact method for analyzing scalability is subject to debate, we focus the analysis on throughput as a way for measuring scalability. Using options analysis, we report on how ranges in which an architecture can scale, can inform the selection of distributed components technology and subsequently the selection of application server products. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: The selection of an architectural style for a given software system is an important factor in satisfying its quality requirements. In battery-powered environments, such as mobile and pervasive systems, efficiency with respect to energy consumption has increasingly been recognized as an important quality attribute. In this paper, we present a framework that (1) facilitates early estimation of the energy consumption induced by an architectural style in a distributed software system, and (2) consequently enables an engineer to use energy consumption estimates along with other quality attributes in determining the most appropriate style for a given distributed application. We have applied the framework on five distributed systems styles to date, and have evaluated it for precision and accuracy using a particular middleware platform that supports the implementation of those styles. In a large number of application scenarios, our framework exhibited excellent precision, in that it was consistently able to correctly rank the five styles and estimate the relative differences in their energy consumptions. Moreover, the framework has also proven to be accurate: its estimates were within 7% of the different style implementations� actually measured energy consumptions. � 2008 IEEE. (13 refs)

Abstract: Although the development of service-based software has evolved greatly in the last years, there is still a lack of accurate development methodologies applied to service orientation. To solve this, we focus on the Model-Driven Development approach, and more specifically in MDA, the proposal by the OMG, as it is one of the main trends in nowadays Software Engineering. Accordingly, we propose to define a Service-Oriented Software Architecture (SOSA) model within a model-driven methodological framework called MIDAS, for the adaptable and flexible development of modern systems. In the present work we study the concepts and elements that need to be defined at a platform independent and neutral abstraction level. This paper reflects our proposal of PIM-level architecture model for Service-Oriented Software Architectures within MIDAS. � 2008 IEEE. (17 refs)

Abstract: During the last years, Intelligent Virtual Environments for Training have become a quite popular application of computer science to education. However, little attention is being paid to software engineering issues, and most systems are developed in an ad-hoc way that does not allow the reuse of their components or an easy modification of the application, even though some authors claim that the use of agents makes systems be more modifiable. We describe an agent-based software architecture that is intended to be easily extended and modified. This architecture is a redesign of a previous one using more formal principles and methods of software architecture design. � 2008 IEEE. (12 refs)

Abstract: System integration effort for feature-rich consumer electronic products is responsible for a significant part of the product cost. The cost of integration becomes so high that profitability of products is under pressure. Systems of subsystems is an architectural style for embedded systems that potentially decreases the effort of system integration by orders of magnitude. This is achieved by integrating software and hardware in two steps. The first integration step results in subsystems; validated, reusable modules consisting of hardware and software. In the second integration step subsystems are combined to form a system. A system of subsystems requires a software architecture that supports distribution of software over subsystems and encapsulates internal complexity of subsystems. A software architecture should also meet practical boundary conditions such as support for reuse of state-of-practice software. However, a large amount of state-of-practice software is not partitioned to be used in an environment where software is distributed over subsystems. Existing software interfaces may expose internal complexity of subsystems when software is distributed. We present an architectural analysis of a portable audio player, following a system of subsystems approach. We created a model of a portable audio player in which each subsystem is represented by a PC and is connected to a LAN representing a network-on-chip. To explore consequences for software reuse, we ported a software stack for media playback to this model. The software was repartitioned to support the requirements of the system architecture. Though we made some architectural changes, a large part of the selected software stack could be reused. � 2008 IEEE. (17 refs)

Abstract: This paper introduces an architectural style for enabling end-users to quickly design and deploy software systems in domains characterized by highly personalized and dynamic requirements. The style offers an intuitive metaphor based on boxes, pipes, and wires, but retains enough preciseness that systems can be automatically assembled and dynamically reconfigured based on uDesign descriptions. uDesign was primarily motivated and validated within monitoring and control applications for smart spaces, but we envision possible extensions to other domains. Our contribution differs from early attempts at enduser programming by dealing with higher level software architectural abstractions rather than programming, and by addressing run-time descriptions rather than code structures. The paper presents validation of uDesign along the following aspects: (a) expressiveness, by means of two case studies, one in health care, and one in home security, (b) soundness, by providing uDesign�s formal semantics, and (c) implementability, by describing a mapping of uDesign to an existing software infrastructure: the Aura infrastructure. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: �The life of a software architect is a long and rapid succession of suboptimal design decisions taken partly in the dark.� [1] The purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the darkness, by discussing a key characteristic of successful software architectures - the use of reusable assets. Reusable assets provide a valuable vehicle for capitalizing on the work of other successful architects, from fine-grained programming idioms to largegrained off-the-shelf packaged solutions. However, consideration of reusable assets can itself be a minefield. There are many different types of asset to consider, and it is not always clear what is meant by each of them, and the value they provide. What is the difference between an architectural style and a reference architecture? How does a mechanism differ from a framework? The purpose of this paper is to discuss the different types of reusable asset available to the architect, their characteristics, and their usage. � 2008 IEEE. (6 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we report on our experience assessing the relationship between the dependency structure of a software architecture and the coordination needs among distributed development teams. We use as a case study for global software development the Global Studio Project Version 3.0, where matrix models were used to represent both architectural dependencies and the coordination structure among the team members. Analysis of data gathered during the Global Studio Project Version 3.0 revealed that design structure matrix (DSM) models representing the modular structure of the software architecture are highly consistent with the social network matrix models that represent the actual coordination structure. We conclude that DSM modeling can help guide the task assignments in global software development projects. � 2008 IEEE. (11 refs)

Abstract: In recent years, management of architectural knowledge has become a more prominent theme in software architecture research. Although various specialized tools have been proposed for use in the architecting process, observations show that architects in industry have yet to meet a tool environment that matches their knowledge needs. In order to discover what architectural knowledge needs architects have, we conducted a study in a large organization. In this study we discovered that architects are especially in need for �Just-In-Time architectural knowledge�. To fulfill this need we designed and implemented an architectural knowledge sharing portal. Our portal�s integrated functionality supports architects in their decision-making process, by providing easy access to the right architectural knowledge at any given point in time. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: Teaching software architecture design in an academic course so that it would equip the students with industrially useful capabilities is challenging. The real software architecture design problems are less clear than what the students are used to learning; the existing mass of assets of an industrial environment is hard to bring into a classroom; and so forth. We have designed a special course into an academic software engineering curriculum, taking into account the industrial needs in teaching the problem of understanding and solving demanding software architecture design problems. The course form is similar to an industrial architecture study assigned to a team of architects. In this paper, we discuss the industrial motivation for the course, the development of the course to its current form, and the lessons learned from running the course. � 2008 IEEE. (7 refs)

Abstract: Modern systems modelling languages frequently support the use of multiple views in order to provide flexible, extensible, and rich mechanisms for capturing system characteristics. Architectural description languages (ADLs) often provide many useful capabilities but fail to provide support for ensuring view consistency simply because they present a single view of the system. An ADL used for building dependable systems must provide multiple views. For these kinds of systems, ensuring view consistency is critical so as to provide guarantees about the system as a whole. In this paper, we outline an architectural modelling language, AIM, which supports multiple views, but we focus on its first-class support for dependency links, which are used to ensure view consistency. We illustrate the principles on examples from a real engine control system. � 2008 Crown Copyright. (9 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach that supports efficient quality impact analyses in the context of iteratively constructed architectures. Since the number of established architectural strategies and the number of inter-related models heavily increase during iterative architecture construction, the impact analysis of newly introduced quality strategies during later stages becomes highly effort-intensive and error-prone. With our approach we mitigate the effort needed for such quality impact analyses by enabling efficient separation of concerns. For achieving efficiency, we developed an aspect-oriented approach that enables the automatic weaving of quality strategies into architectural artifacts. By doing so, we are able to conduct selective quality impact evaluations with significantly reduced effort. � 2008 IEEE. (14 refs)

Abstract: Software architectures are considered crucial because they are the earliest blueprints for target products and at the right level for achieving systemwide qualities. Existing methods of architecture design still face the challenge of bridging the gap between software requirements and architectures in practice. The emerging methods that focus on design decisions and rationale provide little support for deriving target architectures. In this paper we propose a decisioncentric architecture design approach, which models issues, solutions, decisions, and rationale as the core elements of architecture design and the key notions to direct the derivation of target architectures. The approach transits from requirements to architectures through a process including issue eliciting, solution exploiting, solution synthesizing, and architecture deciding. We implement the automated synthesis of candidate architecture solutions from various issue solutions, and provide a way to capture comprehensive design decisions and rationale during this design process. We finally illustrate the applicability of this approach with a case study. � 2008 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: Architectural aspects are expected to modularize widelyscoped concerns that naturally crosscut the boundaries of system components at the software architecture level. However, there is no empirical knowledge about the positive and negative influences of aspectual decompositions on architecture stability. This paper analyzes the influence exerted by the aspect-oriented composition mechanisms in the stability of crosscutting concerns in an evolving multi-agent software architecture. Our investigation encompassed a comparative analysis of aspectual and non-aspectual decompositions based on different architectural styles. In particular, we assessed various facets of components� and compositions� stability through such alternative designs of the same multi-agent system using conventional quantitative indicators. The evaluation focused upon a number of architecturally-relevant changes that are typically performed through real-life maintenance tasks. � 2008 IEEE. (29 refs)

Abstract: Software patterns are generic solutions to recurring problems. They are represented as a triplet (problem, context, solution). Several kinds of software patterns were identified, examples of which are analysis, architecture, design or implementation patterns. The current practice is to represent patterns as documents that communicate best practices. Their reuse is limited by several factors among which the lack of formalization. In the context of architecture centered software development, architectural styles are means to represent families of software systems. Several architecture description languages offer support for representing architectural styles. We believe that the use of architectural styles in the representation of architectural pattern solutions can improve the pattern reuse level. The paper details how this improvement can be achieved. � 2008 IEEE. (26 refs)

Abstract: Simulation is a mean for verifying the quality of an architectural specification. Some approaches have been proposed in the past. Each approach has its own internal simulation engine, and allows for certain types of simulations. Goal of this paper is to propose SASIM, a software architecture-level simulation technique for modeling and simulating architectural specifications. It improves existing techniques, by permitting various kinds of simulation, and making use of SPIN as external simulator. This allows a real and useful integration between simulation and exhaustive verification. The paper discusses SASIM and compares it with existing techniques. � 2008 IEEE. (9 refs)

Abstract: Processes and techniques for the development of enterprise software are best served when infused with practical experience. Pragmatic reflection on what works and what doesn�t is critical to enable successful adoption of any process. One aspect of developing software intensive systems is that of architecture description. A very popular approach to software architecture description is the 4+1 Views of Architecture [1]. From practical experience applying this framework, this paper discuses an amplification of the 4+1 Views approach - the �3+1 Views of Architecture - in 3D�. It is also compliant with the best practices described within the international standard IEEE 1471 - Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems [2]. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: A growing number of mobile users prefer to access information and even make critical business decisions using their mobile phones. We present an integrated architecture developed at SAP Research as a platform for mobile business applications. The immediate goal is to allow mobile users to access information and servies provided by the business back-end servers. The long-term goal is to develop techniques to overcome many problems mobile users face under such constraints as limited bandwidth, computational power and storage resources. The framework that we propose in this paper enables business applications connected to SAP through common mobile devices. SAP users can access business data and applications on the backend server and execute tasks without a PC. We present components of the Lightweight Architecture (LWA) with specific components in the areas of data management, data compression, connectivity, and user interfaces. � 2008 IEEE. (6 refs)

Abstract: With the spread of the Internet and software evolution in complex intensive systems, software architecture often need be reconfigured during runtime to adapt variable environments and design objectives. To deal with reconfigurable software architectures, the formal method should be presented to describe software architectures and express their changes so that these changes on the evolutions of software architectures could be reasoned about. However, current formal methods for reconfigurable software architectures are difficult to represent hierarchy and model contextaware systems. In this paper, we use and extend Bigraph as a formal method to describe reconfigurable software architecture. By providing graphic elements and term languages, extended bigraphs can survey static and dynamic architectures easily. Then we represent basic architectural operations based on extended bigraphs, through a case describe reconfigurations with constraints and context-aware information by reaction rules, and illustrate how to check the properties to satisfy design requirements by BiLog. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: Software architecture modeling and representation became a main phase of the development process of complex systems. In fact, software architecture representation provides many advantages during all phases of software life cycle. Nevertheless, for many systems, like legacy or eroded ones, there is no available representation of their architectures. In order to benefit from this representation, we propose, in this paper, an approach called ROMANTIC which focuses on extracting a component-based architecture of an existing object-oriented system. The main idea of this approach is to propose a quasi-automatic process of architecture recovery based on semantic and structural characteristics of software architecture concepts. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: The explicit documentation of the rationale of design decisions is a practice generally encouraged, but rarely implemented in industry because of a variety of inhibitors. Methods proposed in the past for Design Decisions Rationale Documentation (DDRD) aimed to maximize benefits for the DDRD consumer by imposing on the producer of DDRD the burden to document all the potentially useful information. We propose here a compromise which consists in tailoring DDRD, based on its intended use or purpose. In our view, the adoption of a tailored DDRD, consisting only of the required set of information, would mitigate the effects of DDRD inhibitors. The aim of this paper is twofold: i) to discuss the application of Value-Based Software Engineering principles to DDRD, ii) to describe a controlled experiment to empirically analyze the feasibility of the proposed method. Results show that the level of utility related to the same category of DDRD information significantly changes depending on its purpose; such result is novel and it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed valuebased DDRD. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: Designers have long recognized the value of modularity, but important software modularity principles have remained informal. According to Baldwin and Clark�s [1] design rule theory (DRT), modular architectures add value to system designs by creating options to improve the system by substituting or experimenting on individual modules. In this paper, we examine the design evolution of two software product platforms through the modeling lens of DRT and design structure matrices (DSMs). We show that DSM models and DRT precisely explain how realworld modularization activities in one case allowed for different rates of evolution in different software modules and in another case conferred distinct strategic advantages on a firm by permitting substitution of an at-risk software module without substantial change to the rest of the system. Our results provide positive evidence that DSM and DRT can inform important aspects of large-scale software structure and evolution, having the potential to guide software architecture design activities. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: The question of the �manner in which an existing software architecture affects requirements decisionmaking� is recognised as important in the research community; however, to our knowledge, this issue has not been scientifically explored. This paper describes an exploratory study on this question. Specific types of architectural effects on requirements decisions are identified, as are different aspects of the architecture together with the extent of their effects. This paper gives quantitative measures and qualitative interpretation of the findings. The understanding gained from this study has several implications in the areas of: project planning and risk management, requirements engineering and software architecture technology, architecture evolution, tighter integration of Requirements Engineering and Software Architecting processes, and middleware in architectures. The study involved six requirements engineering teams (of university students), whose task was to elicit new requirements for upgrading a preexisting banking software infrastructure. The data collected was based on a new meta-model for requirements decisions, which is a bi-product of this study. � 2008 IEEE. (25 refs)

Abstract: Service composition is one of the key objectives for adopting Service Oriented Architecture. Today, web services, however, are not always perfectly compatible and composition mismatches are common problems. Service mediation, generally classified into signature and protocol ones, thus becomes one key working area in SOA. While the former has received considerable attention, protocol mediation is still open and current approaches provide only partial solutions. In this paper, a pattern-based approach is proposed for developers to semi-automatically generate mediators and glue partially compatible services together. Based on the investigation on workflow patterns and message exchanging sequences in service interactions, several basic mediator patterns are developed and can be used to modularly construct advanced mediators that can resolve all possible protocol mismatches, especially such mismatches about complicated control logics. Moreover, the architecture for the service mediation system is designed and implemented to prove the feasibility of our approach. � 2008 IEEE. (21 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture practice is highly complex. Software architects interact with business as well as technical aspects of systems, often embedded in large and changing organizations. We first make an argument that an appropriate research agenda for understanding, describing, and changing architectural practice in this context is based on an action research agenda in which researchers use ethnographic techniques to understand practice and engages directly with and in practice when proposing and designing new practices. Secondly, we present an overview of an ongoing project which applies action research techniques to understand and potentially change architectural practice in four Danish software companies. � 2008 IEEE.

Abstract: During the last decades software architecture has become increasingly important for companies creating competitive product structures. Recently more and more attention has also been focused on the costs, cost-effectiveness, productivity and value of software development and products. This study outlines concepts, principles and process of implementing a value assessment for SW architecture. The main purpose of this study is to collect experiences whether the value assessment for product architecture is useful for companies, works in practice, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of using it. This is done by implementing value assessment in a case company step by step to see which phases possibly work and which phases possibly do not work. The practical industrial case shows that proposed value assessment for product architecture is useful and supports companies trying to find value in product architecture. � 2008 IEEE. (5 refs)

Abstract: When constructing software systems, software architects must identify and evaluate many competing design options and document the rationale behind any selections made. Two supporting concepts are pattern languages and architectural decision models. Unfortunately, both concepts only provide partial support: Extensive upfront education is needed for practitioners to be in command of the full pattern literature relevant in their field; retrospective architectural decision modeling is viewed as a painful extra responsibility without immediate gains. In this paper, we combine pattern languages and reusable architectural decision models into a design method that is both comprehensive and comprehensible. Our design method identifies the required decisions in requirements models systematically, gives domainspecific pattern selection advice, and provides traceability from platform-independent patterns to platform-specific decisions. We validate our approach by applying it to enterprise applications as an exemplary application genre and a SOA case study from the finance industry. � 2008 IEEE. (28 refs)

Abstract: Building high performance analytical applications for data streams generated from sensors is a challenging software engineering problem. Such applications typically comprise a complex pipeline of processing components that capture, transform and analyze the incoming data stream. In addition, applications must provide high throughput, be scalable and easily modifiable so that new analytical components can be added with minimum effort. In this paper we describe the MeDICi Integration Framework (MIF), which is a middleware platform we have created to address these challenges. The MIF extends an open source messaging platform with a component-based API for integrating components into analytical pipelines. We describe the features and capabilities of the MIF, and show how it has been used to build a production analytical application for detecting cyber security attacks. The application was composed from multiple independently developed components using several different programming languages. The resulting application was able to process network sensor traffic in real time and provide insightful feedback to network analysts as soon as potential attacks were recognized. (22 refs)

Abstract: This paper describes a component model and component-based architecture of smart devices and systems that are designed to enhance life quality and well being of elderly individuals. In addition to providing the traditional view of hardware, firmware and software components, the model also provides developers with an operational view. The view enables the developer to specify device-user interactions as executable workflows and allows the device operations and user actions to be experimented with and their correctness ascertained throughout the design and development process. The paper also presents a simulation environment for this purpose. � 2008 IEEE. (16 refs)

Abstract: Data intensive computing is concerned with creating scalable solutions for capturing, analyzing, managing and understanding multi-terabyte and petabyte data volumes. Such data volumes exist in a diverse range of application domains, including scientific research, bioinformatics, cyber security, social computing and commerce. Innovative hardware and software technologies to address these problems must scale to meet these ballooning data volumes and simultaneously reduce the time needed to provide effective data analysis. This paper describes some of the software architecture challenges that must be addressed when building data intensive applications and supporting infrastructures. These revolve around requirements for adaptive resource utilization and management, flexible integration, robustness and scalable data management. (4 refs)

Abstract: The Influencing Factors (IF) method guides the architect through stakeholders� concerns to architectural decisions in line with current business goals. The result is a set of requirements on software quality attributes and business goals and highlighted trade-offs among software quality attributes and among business goals. The IF method is suitable for sustainable software systems since it allows new concerns, resulting from changes in business goals, stakeholder concerns, technical environment and organization, to be added to existing concerns. � 2008 IEEE.
