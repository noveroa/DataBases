Abstract: Architectural knowledge consists of architecture design as well as the design decisions, assumptions, context, and other factors that together determine why a particular solution is the way it is. Except for the architecture design part, most of the architectural knowledge usually remains hidden, tacit in the heads of the architects. We conjecture that an explicit representation of architectural knowledge is helpful for building and evolving systems. If we had a repository of architectural knowledge for a system, what would it ideally contain, how would we build it, and exploit it in practice? In this paper we describe a use case model for an architectural knowledge system. � 2005 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: Inconsistencies between software views are a source of errors for software systems. In this paper we present a general approach that aids in finding inconsistencies between different views. This approach supports both intra phase consistency checking and inter phase consistency checking. The approach is suitable for detecting consistency problems between, for example, multiple diagrams in a UML design as well as between a design and an implementation. The approach is based on verification of rules using relation partition algebra. In this paper, we present two types of rules: obligations and the more commonly used constraints, which can be viewed as lower bounds and upper bounds, respectively. To check consistency between views, rules are derived from one view, the so-called prevailing view, and imposed on another view, the so-called subordinate view. Because our approach does not prescribe which views are prevailing, it can be used in any arbitrary process. Violations to rules can be expressed in terms of either the prevailing view or the subordinate view. Exceptions to rules are easiliy embedded in our general approach to consistency checking. � 2005 IEEE. (18 refs)

Abstract: The Architecting session examined the development of software architectures. Seven papers were presented, covering both the state of the practice and new architecting approaches. Based on the paper presentations and subsequent discussions, we concluded that tool support is a barrier to adoption of methods, and that architectural knowledge, including domain-specific knowledge and understanding of patterns and styles is essential but difficult to communicate. A related issue, the documentation of an architecture, is similarly critical but not easy to do well, and better techniques and tools are needed. Finally, we agreed that agile methods do not bring fundamental changes to the practice of architecting. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: Software architecture reconstruction is essentially the process of creating a set of architectural views with the information recovered from the actual implementation of a software system. While recovering the basic facts about the implementation can be automated with source code analyzers, mapping them to logical concepts is mainly a conceptual activity. We investigate the problem of how to bridge the logical and concrete domains for the purpose of creating architectural views. Our conclusion is that there is still a considerable gap between the theoretical framework and the practical experiences. This hinders the possibility of developing a general, rigorous and effective architecture reconstruction method. � 2005 IEEE. (6 refs)

Abstract: Recent research has recognised the potential of coupling ADLs with underlying runtime environments to support systematic and integrated �specification-to-deployment� architectures. However, while some promising results have been obtained, much of this research has not considered the crucial issue of causally-connected dynamic reconfiguration and has considered only domain-specific areas. In this paper we discuss a specification-to-deployment architecture called Plastik that employs an extended general-purpose ADL and is underpinned by an efficient runtime that is suited both for high-level application development and low-level systems development (e.g. embedded systems). Runtime reconfiguration is supported both at the ADL level and at the runtime level, and both programmed reconfiguration and adhoc reconfiguration are supported. The paper focuses on the mapping of ADL-level specifications to runtime instantiations and on the necessary runtime support for causally-connected dynamic reconfiguration. � 2005 IEEE. (30 refs)

Abstract: This paper describes an approach for generating customized benchmark applications from a software architecture description using a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) approach. The benchmark generation and performance data capture tool implementation is based on widely used open source MDA frameworks. The business logic of the benchmark application is modeled in UML and generated by taking advantage of the existing generation �cartridges� so that the current component technology can be exploited in the benchmark, This greatly reduces the effort and expertise needed for benchmarking with complex component technology. We have also extended the MDA framework to model and generate a load testing suite and automatic performance measurement infrastructure. The approach complements current model-based performance prediction and analysis methods by generating the benchmark application from the same application architecture that the performance models are derived from. This provides the potential for tightly integrating runtime performance measurement with model-based prediction either for model validation or improving model prediction accuracy. We illustrate the approach using a case study based on EJB component technology. � 2005 IEEE. (25 refs)

Abstract: Classical science advances via the dance between quantitative observation and theoretical construction. It has been ten years since the first International Software Architecture Workshop, and since that time there has been a steady increase in the number of people who call themselves �software architect� and a similar growth in the value that organizations place in software architecture. It is a sign of maturity for any given engineering discipline when we can name, study, and apply the patterns relevant to that domain but, unfortunately, no such reference yet exists for software-intensive systems. We�ve architected and deployed many systems, but have studied their patterns of success and failure only a little; we�ve explored theoretical frameworks for describing software architectures and processes to build them, but we�ve done only a modest job in validating them in the real world. In this presentation, I�ll summarize the things we know and the things we don�t know (and speculate on the things we don�t know we know) about software architecture. I�ll then examine an effort to create a handbook of software architecture to help fill this gap between observation and construction. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: Software Product Lines (SPL), Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components provide a rich supporting base for creating software architectures. Further, they promise significant improvements in the quality of software configurations that can be composed from pre-built components. Software architectural styles provide a way for achieving a desired coherence for such component-based architectures. This is because the different architectural styles enforce different quality attributes for a system. If the architectural style of an emergent system could be predicted in advance, a System Integrator could make necessary changes to ensure that the quality attributes dictated by the system requirements were satisfied before the actual system was deployed and tested. In this paper we propose a model for predicting architectural styles based on use cases that need to be met by a system configuration. Moreover, our technique can be used to determine stylistic conformance and hence indicate the presence or absence of architectural drift � 2005 IEEE. (7 refs)

Abstract: The study of software architectures is gaining importance due to its role in various aspects of software engineering such as product line engineering, component based software engineering and other emerging paradigms. With the increasing emphasis on design patterns, the traditional practice of ad-hoc software construction is slowly shifting towards pattern-oriented development. Various architectural attributes like error propagation, change propagation, and requirements propagation, provide a wealth of information about software architectures. In this paper, we show that change propagation probability (CP) is helpful and effective in assessing the design quality of software architectures. We study two different architectures (one that employs patterns versus one that does not) for the same application, We also analyze and compare change propagation metric with respect to other coupling-based metrics. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: In the whole system composed by traditional OS and the applications above, the states are distributed into each layer of the system because of the hierarchy. This increases the difficulties of fault diagnosis and recovery in autonomous computing. In addition, the monitor process that examines the application still belongs to the application. This is awkward because it is the application itself that monitors itself. We propose a new autonomous OS software architecture. By imitating the octopus, the architecture adopts two layers of feedback closed loops and manages the important states of the whole system centrally. The feedback closed loops running on the higher privilege level monitor the ones running on the lower privilege level. Its main innovative features are: i. Treat OS and the applications above as one whole system. ii. The application cannot monitor itself. Processes with higher privilege level monitor processes with lower privilege level. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) offer a flexible solution to the integration of systems, applications, protocols, data sources, and processes into a cohesive system to support critical business operations. A major challenge in these service-based systems is how to ensure the availability and reliability of web services upon which user applications and services are built. This paper describes a high-availability SOA platform for deploying and integrating enterprise applications. This SOA platform has been used to deploy and integrate multiple large enterprise applications that are used throughout Motorola for the past few years. � 2005 IEEE. (5 refs)

Abstract: We compare five industrial software architecture design methods and we extract from their commonalities a general software architecture design approach. Using this general approach, we compare across the five methods the artifacts and activities they use or recommend, and we pinpoint similarities and differences. Once we get beyond the great variance in terminology and description, we find that the 5 approaches have a lot in common and match more or less the �ideal�pattern we introduced. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: Many formal languages have been proposed so far to describe software architectures (SA), but only very few of them are still supported and used in practical contexts. Many UML profiles and extensions have been provided when UML became a standard, in order to model as much as possible architectural concepts. They allow for an easy integration in industrial processes, however, different analysis techniques and domains still require different notations. In fact, since different communities require different information to be put into a diagram, depending on which architectural design aspects should be represented and analyzed, the idea of an unified UML language for SA is not adequate. Building on these considerations, we propose DUALLY, a core set of UML concepts, well suited for SA modeling, together with a framework which provides extensibility mechanisms to adapt the initial notation, in order to meet different needs. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: In practice, there are many differences between an implementation-level architecture (such as one derived using architectural recovery techniques) and a more conceptual architecture used at design time. We present a lightweight, scalable, semi-automated, incremental approach for synchronizing a Component-and-Connector (C&C) view retrieved from an implementation with a conceptual C&C view described in an Architectural Description Language. Our approach can automatically detect corresponding elements in the presence of insertions, deletions, renames, and moves, and incrementally synchronize the two views. � 2005 IEEE. (4 refs)

Abstract: Dynamic memory management is one part of the software system that influences the performance and the cost of a product the most. In the context of an embedded real-time system, several requirements must be taken into account. The system must be optimized due to the limitation of memory. Real-time deadlines must be respected: the dynamic memory management system must allocate and deallocate blocks in due time. One more challenge is represented when a dynamic memory management system is developed for a product family architecture, which is representative of a set of related products. We present a scenarios-based approach to analyze and evaluate dynamic memory management systems for embedded real-time systems in a software product family architecture. Architectural transformations and improvements against the tradeoffs for the software product family are analyzed. � 2005 IEEE. (3 refs)

Abstract: This position paper argues that Architecture should not be captured and maintained as a set of views, but as an instance of an architectural meta-model or ontology. The ontology provides a common architecture language, or vocabulary, that enables the level of precision needed for effective architecture decision making. Our proposed ontology is composed of architecture assets, architecture decisions, stakeholder concerns and an architecture implementation roadmap. We see this approach as an alternative to traditional view-based methods. � 2005 IEEE. (7 refs)

Abstract: Many claims have been made about the problems caused by not documenting design rationale. The general perception is that designers and architects usually do not fully understand the critical role of systematic use and capture of design rationale. However, there is to date little empirical evidence available on what design rationale mean to practitioners, how valuable they consider them, and how they use and document design rationale during the design process. This paper reports an empirical study that surveyed practitioners to probe their perception of the value of design rationale and how they use and document background knowledge related to their design decisions. Based on eighty-one valid responses, this study has discovered that practitioners recognize the importance of documenting design rationale and frequently use them to reason about their design choices. However, they have indicated barriers to the use and documentation of design rationale. Based on the findings, we conclude that much research is needed to develop methodology and tool support for design rationale capture and usage. Furthermore, we put forward some research questions that would benefit from further investigation into design rationale in order to support practice in industry. � 2005 IEEE. (32 refs)

Abstract: Software product-line engineering aims to maximize reuse by exploiting the commonality within families of related systems. Its success depend on capturing the commonality and variability, and using this to evolve a reference architecture for the product family. With embedded system families, the possibility of variability in hardware and operating system platforms is an added complication. In this paper we outline a strategy for evolving reference architectures from bi-directional feature models. The proposed strategy complements information provided by the feature model with scenarios that help to elaborate feature behavior. � 2005 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: The architecture of a software system is a key asset for a software business. While there are several architecting and evaluation methods, literature and practice are devoid of architecture-centric concern-analysis (ACCA) methods analogous to causal analysis methods for software defects. A concern is any aspect of an architecture considered undesirable. This paper describes an ACCA method which uses at its core a Concern Traceability map (CT-map) that captures architectural design decisions starting from software requirements and links them to identified architectural concerns. The CT-map essentially forms a net of design decisions, sandwiched between requirements and architectural concerns. Analysis of the root causes of a concern is then conducted on the CT-map. The ACCA method is empirically validated through a case study on a sizeable architecture of a banking application. � 2005 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: It is argued that architecture comprehension and regression testing of a software system are the most expensive maintenance activities. This is mainly due to the fact that architectural choices are either not explicit, at every stage of the software development process, or not preserved from one stage to another. In this paper, we present an Architectural Constraint Language (ACL) as a means to formally describe architectural choices at all the stages. This language is based on the UML�s Object Constraint Language and on a set of MOF-compliant metamodels. We also present a prototype which validates the proposed approach. It allows the evaluation of ACL expressions at two stages and ensures, by using a transformation mechanism, that the constraints stated at one stage are subsequently preserved. � 2005 IEEE. (19 refs)

Abstract: Architecture-based development of software product lines requires well established methodologies for both development and assessment of software product line architectures. While several methodologies for the development of such systems have been proposed, their assessment has mostly relied on methods developed for single product architectures. In this paper, we extend the popular ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) method to cover both the core architecture of the product line and the individual product architectures. In addition, the extended method prescribes a qualitative analytical treatment of variation points using scenarios. We present the main tenets of the new method and illustrate its use through a small case study. � 2005 IEEE. (16 refs)

Abstract: We present an overview of SPQR, the System for Pattern Query and Recognition, a toolkit that detects instances of known design patterns directly from object-oriented source code in an automated and flexible manner. Based on our previous work in ?-calculus and Pattern/Object Markup Language (POML), SPQR is retargetable to most OO languages, and system design notations. We discuss how this approach may he applied to architectural concerns by leveraging SPQR�s training mode. The System for Pattern Query and Recognition, or SPQR, is an automated framework to analyze software systems in the small or the large, and detect instances of known programming concepts in a flexible yet formal manner. These concepts, combined in well-defined ways to form abstractions, as found in the design patterns literature, then lead to the possible automated detection of design patterns directly from source code and other design artifacts. Our previous publications [7, 8] have described SPQR in detail, as well as its successful application to a number of software systems. Here we describe SPQR briefly, and how these principles can be extended to architectural analysis. � 2005 IEEE. (8 refs)

Abstract: It is widely recognized that a good and appropriate architecture is critical to the success of a software product or system [5]. However, neither the system nor its architecture is static, and a good architecture anticipates and guides the evolution of the system over time. As the system evolves over time, the role of the software architect evolves as well, and skills that enabled an architect to be successful during one phase of a system�s lifetime may not enable success in later phases. This paper proposes a three-phase model to describe the evolution of software systems, and describes the contributions of the software architect which are necessary for success in each phase. This topic is of interest to practicing architects, and to software development managers responsible for selecting and hiring architects to contribute to a software system. � 2005 IEEE. (24 refs)

Abstract: Research into design rationale in the past has focused on the representation of reasons and has omitted the connections between design rationales and design artefacts. Without such connections, designers and architects cannot easily assess how changing requirements or designs may affect the system. In this paper, we introduce a model called Architecture Rationale and Element Linkage (AREL) to represent the causal relationship between architecture elements and decisions. We further model AREL as a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to capture the probabilistic relationships between architecture elements and decisions in an architecture design model. Such probabilistic modelling enables architects to quantitatively predict and diagnose impact of change when part of the requirements or designs are changing. Using a partial design of a cheque image processing system, we illustrate how AREL is used to represent the decision model and how BBN is used to predict and diagnose change in the architecture design. We use a UML tool to capture the AREL model and a BBN tool to compute the probabilities of change impact. � 2005 IEEE. (29 refs)

Abstract: Without rigorous software development and maintenance, software tends to lose its original architectural structure and become more difficult to understand and modify. ArchJava, a recently proposed implementation language which embeds a component-and-connector architectural specification within Java implementation code, offers the promise of preventing the loss of architectural structure. We describe a case study in which we incrementally re-engineer an existing implementation with an eroded architecture to obtain an ArchJava implementation that more closely matches an idealized architecture. Building on results from similar case studies, we chose an application consisting of over 16,000 source lines of Java code and 80 classes that exhibited many characteristics of real-world legacy applications. We describe our process, some lessons learned, as well as some perceived limitations with the tools, techniques and languages we used. � 2005 IEEE. (28 refs)

Abstract: Software architectures have high costs for change, are complex, and erode during evolution. We believe these problems are partially due to knowledge vaporization. Currently, almost all the knowledge and information about the design decisions the architecture is based on are implicitly embedded in the architecture, but lack a first-class representation. Consequently, knowledge about these design decisions disappears into the architecture, which leads to the aforementioned problems. In this paper, a new perspective on software architecture is presented, which views software architecture as a composition of a set of explicit design decisions. This perspective makes architectural design decisions an explicit part of a software architecture. Consequently, knowledge vaporization is reduced, thereby alleviating some of the fundamental problems of software architecture. � 2005 IEEE. (22 refs)

Abstract: A key aspect in creating autonomous dynamic software systems is the possibility of reasoning about properties of runtime variability and dynamic behavior, e.g. when and how to reconfigure the system. Currently these properties are often not made explicit in the software architecture. We argue that having explicit models for the different architectural elements is a necessity, as it enables separation of concerns both pre-deployment and post-deployment. In this paper we propose a reconfiguration process based on a number of explicit models.

Abstract: The GEAR process integrates three approaches to architectural requirements engineering: model-driven requirements engineeering, quality attribute scenarios, and global analysis, within an iterative, incremental analysis process. In so doing, it shows where these methods overlap and where they complement each other. It also adds insight into the differences between product requirements and architecture requirements. GEAR incorporates experience from over a dozen diverse industrial software architecture projects. � 2005 IEEE. (9 refs)

Abstract: This paper proposes a Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach for the development of real time On-Board Software (OBS) for satellites starting from its UML modeling. The MDA definition is considered in a broad sense in which code is (semi-) automatically generated from more abstract models, A Model-Driven Development (MDD) tool tailored for real time applications is used for software construction, which provides more general resources than just supporting UML documentation and high-level design �drafting�. This allows for model execution where one may find problems and issues that whiteboarding and document reviews are unable to find, Moreover, an incremental development, based in the 4+1 architectural views, can be effectively attained even at high-level architectural models. A layered model is suggested for the logical architectural view of the OBS domain. � 2005 IEEE. (3 refs)

Abstract: Correct assembly of software components is an important issue in Component Based Software Engineering. Composing a system from reusable components often introduces a set of problems related to communication and compatibility. In particular, one of the main problems in component assembly is that components may have incompatible interaction behavior. In this paper, we address this problem using an architecture-based approach that can detect integration mismatches, and semi-automatically synthesize a suitable adaptor, or glue code, to bridge them. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: A crucial aspect of the software architect�s role is to ensure that a system based on their architecture will exhibit the quality properties (performance, security, availability and so on) that are important to their stakeholders. A proven approach to help guide an architect through the process of designing an architecture is to use architectural views, based on formal viewpoint definitions (such as those in the well known �4+1� set). However, a practical problem we have found when using existing viewpoint sets is the lack of guidance relating to system qualities (as opposed to system structures) that they provide. To address this problem, we identified a complimentary concept, called the architectural perspective [15], to provide an architect with practical guidance as to how to ensure that their system exhibits the right set of quality properties. This paper reviews the idea of the architectural perspective and relates a specific experience of applying them to the architectural definition of an enterprise integration project for a financial markets organisation, explaining the strengths and weaknesses we found in the approach. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: Recent research shows runtime architectural reflection is instrumental in, for instance, building adaptive and flexible systems or checking correspondence between design and implementation. Moreover, experience with computational reflection in various branches of computer science shows that the interface through which the meta-information of the running system is accessed, and possibly modified, lies at the heart of designing reflective systems. This paper proposes that such an interface should be like a database: accessed through queries expressed using the concepts with which architecture is described. Specifically, our contributions are: (1) a presentation of the general idea of a query-based approach to architectural reflection, (2) a definition of an Architectural Query Language (AQL) in which perspectives on an architectural model can be expressed as queries, (3) a prototype of a system which both creates runtime models of specific distributed architectures and allow for evaluation of AQL queries on these models. We illustrate the viability of the approach in two particular applications of such a model: constraint checking relative to an architectural style, and reasoning about certain quality attributes of an architecture. � 2005 IEEE.

Abstract: Architecture recovery is usually supported by a set of tools that implement techniques, such as concept analysis, clustering, data mining and pattern matching for abstracting low-level source code elements into higher-level architectural elements. However, the decision making in this process usually depends on a previously defined high-level model of the system architecture or on criteria that are application dependent. In this paper we present a set of application independent clustering criteria to support architectural elements definition. These criteria help the user in his decision making and can be reused in many different contexts. � 2005 IEEE. (6 refs)

Abstract: In the software architecture education session, we discussed four main issues: how to make a software architecture course sufficiently realistic, how to teach non-technical competencies of software architects, the place of such a course in a university curriculum, and how to grow software architects beyond the university. The session resulted in a first sketch of software architecture knowledge areas, and the extent to which these are deemed required for certain classes of software professionals. � 2005 IEEE. (4 refs)

Abstract: Obtaining the appropriate architecture for a software system assures the long-term success of the product. Without a well defined and documented architecture is very hard or impossible to analyze and evaluate the quality of the product and the change impact. Thus it is very expensive to communicate to each stakeholder the information needed. Many existing approaches propose models based on a �closed� set of views to document architectures, such as �4+1� model, Siemens� model, etcetera. Nevertheless, industrial practices in Small and Medium size Enterprises (SME) works informally, often even not documenting. From a practical experience where the 4+1 model was applied, it was noticed that there were views not proposed that were interesting, therefore a method was defined to select the views that really turn out useful to document in each case. To this end, the approach proposed by Clements et al [1] has been adapted. � 2005 IEEE. (4 refs)
