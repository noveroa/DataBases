Abstract: Access to previously made architectural design decisions allows for faster understanding and more educated decisions during software evolution. Templates and ontologies have been proposed to document such decisions. In this paper we argue that documenting the architectural design decisions can be intertwined with a standard architecture documentation process. For that, we propose architecture-specific decision types equipped with OCL constraints capable for decision conformance checks. We present an initial evaluation based on a preliminary case study with a typical three-tier web-application and the decisions associated with its implementation. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (12 refs)

Abstract: Due to the increasingly complexity of industry software products, software architecture evaluation is getting important to effectively identify potential risks and ensure the quality goals of the resulting system are well addressed in the design phase. However, despite the plethora of evaluation approaches proposed in academia, few of them have proven suitable to evaluate architecture designs of wide spread industry applications. As the initial efforts of addressing this issue, this paper identifies the gaps between an ideal industry friendly software architecture evaluation approach and existing evaluation methods. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: With the evolution of distributed systems in size and complexity, software deployment remains a challenging task. Despite the existence of several approaches, most of them use informal models that lack a solid mathematic foundation. In this paper, we propose a bigraphical based approach for modeling and formalizing the deployment of distributed applications. This approach relies on multi-scale modeling. So, we start by modeling the first scale with a bigraph. This bigraph is enriched, through a series of reaction rules, until reaching the last scale that represents the deployment architecture. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (9 refs)

Abstract: The swap mechanism allows an operating system to work with more memory than available RAM space, by temporarily flushing some data to disk. However, the system sometimes ends up spending more time swapping data in and out of disk than performing actual computation. This state is called thrashing. Classical strategies against thrashing rely on reducing system load, so as to decrease memory pressure and increase global throughput. Those approaches may however be counterproductive when tricked into advantaging malicious or long-standing processes. This is particularily true in the context of shared hosting or virtualization, where multiple users run uncoordinated and selfish workloads. To address this challenge, we propose an accounting layer that forces swap fairness among processes competing for main memory. It ensures that a process cannot monopolize the swap subsystem by delaying the swap operations of abusive processes, reducing the number of system-wide page faults while maximizing memory utilization. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Inadequate version control has been identified as a major obstacle to the application of model-driven software engineering. In particular, sophisticated support for merging model versions is urgently needed. We present a tool for merging of EMF models which may be applied to instances of arbitrary Ecore models. The tool advances the state of the art by guaranteeing a consistent merge result. Furthermore, it detects and resolves not only context-free, but also context-sensitive conflicts. Our merge tool is model-based; it relies on EMF for its implementation. Initial experiences gained from its application confirm that the merge tool operates both accurately and efficiently. � 2013 ACM. (28 refs)

Abstract: During the last years, the area of Service Science Management and Engineering (SSME) is one of those fields that have benefit from the advantages brought by Model-Driven Engineering in terms of leveraging the abstraction level at which software is conceived, designed or even implemented. One of the key issues in SSME is evolution, given the non-trivial nature of updating widely distributed and heterogeneous systems. In this context, this work introduces an EMF-based toolkit that bundles different DSLs, injectors/extractors and transformations to put into practice and explore some formal theories on the evolution of Web Services. � 2013 ACM.

Abstract: This paper presents a tool called MTC Flow, which allows model-driven developers to design, develop, test and deploy Model Transformation Chains (MTCs). The tool offers a graphical DSL for defining MTC workflow models independently of the technologies that support the transformations. Using basic concepts such as metamodels, models and transformations (M2M, M2T and T2M) the user defines, executes and tests his MTC easily in the same development environment. MTC Flow has an abstraction layer to implement technology support. It facilitates the interoperability of model transformation and validation using the existing technologies without changes. Additionally, once the MTC is finished, MTC Flow offers an option to deploy it in any environment that support JAVA technology. The tool supports modularity and alternative execution paths of the MTCs. It was built on top of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF). The tool offers a development environment using the extending capabilities of the Eclipse platform. We illustrate how MTC Flow supports MTCs development process using an example. � 2013 ACM.

Abstract: UML modeling environments for doing model-based testing are often not very comfortable to use and burden some knowledge about the internals of UML to the users, respectively test engineers. Test engineers, however, are seldom experts in UML, thus, the gain of efficiency model-based testing approaches entail, is reduced by a too generic tooling. The tool Fokus!MBT, developed by the competence center MOTION of Fraunhofer FOKUS, is a multi-paradigmatic test modeling environment based on the UML Testing Profile, an OMG-adopted industry-driven notation for model-based testing. Fokus!MBT simplifies the creation and authoring of test models with methodology-specific support. It is built on top of Eclipse Papyrus, a powerful open source UML modeling environment, which, in turn, relies on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Graphical Modeling Framework. This paper provides deep insights into the basic concepts and technical realization of Fokus!MBT as well as into the lessons we have learned during development and application. � 2013 ACM. (36 refs)

Abstract: In our work, we promote a new discipline for secure and dependable system engineering using a pattern as its first class citizen: Pattern-Based System Engineering (PBSE). Therefore, PBSE addresses two kind of processes: the one of pattern development and the one of system development with patterns. To interconnect these two processes we promote a structured model-based repository of patterns and their related property models. This paper presents the SEMCO MDE Tool Suite development status conducted in the context of the FP7 TERESA project aiming to support the automation of building, storing and processing reusable artifacts (S&D patterns and property models). This tool promotes the PBSE methodology in the domain of assistance to the trusted embedded system engineering.

Abstract: In many domains, models are created based on predefined metamodels which abstract the structure of the domain in question. However, there are specific domains, like Enterprise Architecture (EA) projects, where a metamodel cannot be defined in advance to the creation of the model. Unfortunately, in this situation using standard frameworks, like EMF, generates some inconveniences in the construction of the model and the metamodel because these frameworks do not support the manipulation of metamodels at runtime. In this paper, we propose a strategy to co-create metamodels and models in an incremental and simultaneous way. This proposal is supported by a dynamic approach that separates the linguistic and the ontological conformity concerns of metamodeling. This strategy has been implemented in a graphical editor called GraCoT, which also provides interactive assistance to guide the users during the co-creation process. � 2013 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: Since the groundbreaking work of Kamin, Reddy, and particularly Cook in the late 1980s, there has been broad agreement that the meaning of inheritance in object-oriented programming languages can be best explained using generator functions and their fixpoints. Consequently, it is a little surprising to realise that no current mainstream programming language actually explains inheritance to its users in this way. Instead, most languages make up a �story� that purports to explain inheritance, but that on closer inspection contains serious flaws. It is as if, being asked to explain the facts of life to our children, we are so embarrassed by the truth that we make up a story about storks, knowing even as we do so that it defies the laws not only of biology but also of physics. This paper explores both the truth and the fictions about how objects are brought into the world. My hope is that future programming languages can tell the children, if not the whole truth, then at least a partial truth that is consistent with the laws of mathematics.

Abstract: The simplest and purest practical object-oriented language designs today are seen in dynamically-typed languages, such as Smalltalk and Self. Static types, however, have potential benefits for productivity, security, and reasoning about programs. In this paper, we describe the design ofWyvern, a statically typed, pure object-oriented language that attempts to retain much of the simplicity and expressiveness of these iconic designs. Our goals lead us to combine pure object-oriented and functional abstractions in a simple, typed setting. We present a foundational object-based language that we believe to be as close as one can get to simple typed lambda calculus while keeping objectorientation. We show how this foundational language can be translated to the typed lambda calculus via standard encodings.We then define a simple extension to this language that introduces classes and show that classes are no more than sugar for the foundational object-based language. Our future intention is to demonstrate that modules and other object-oriented features can be added to our language as not more than such syntactical extensions while keeping the object-oriented core as pure as possible. The design of Wyvern closely follows both historical and modern ideas about the essence of object-orientation, suggesting a new way to think about a minimal, practical, typed core language for objects.

Abstract: This position paper argues that inheritance and parameterization differ in their fundamental structure, even though they may emulate each other in many ways. Based on this, we claim that certain mechanisms, e.g., final classes, are in conflict with the nature of inheritance, and hence causes language designs to be less generalizable and more prone to semantic conflicts, and hence we recommend that these mechanisms should be optimized for playing different roles in language design.

Abstract: Feature-oriented programming extends object-oriented programming to support feature modularity. Feature modules typically cut across class boundaries to implement end-uservisible features. Customized program variants can be composed automatically given a selection of desired feature modules. We propose behavioral feature interfaces based on design by contract for precise localization of faulty feature modules. There are three different approaches for feature-module composition, which are considered to be equivalent in the literature. We discuss advantages and disadvantages for each approach with regard to behavioral feature interfaces. Based on our insights, we present Subclack as a new approach for feature-module composition combining the advantages of all existing approaches. In our examples, we use contracts defined in an feature-oriented extension of the Java Modeling Language, and discuss how they can be checked by means of runtime assertions. (33 refs)

Abstract: The execution context in which pervasive systems or mobile computing run changes continuously. Hence, applications for these systems should be adapted at run-time according to the current context. In order to implement a context-aware dynamic reconfiguration service, most approaches usually require to model at design-time both the list of all possible configurations and the plans to switch among them. In this paper we present an alternative approach for the automatic run-time generation of application configurations and the reconfiguration plans. The generated configurations are optimal regarding different criteria, such as functionality or resource consumption (e.g. battery or memory). This is achieved by: (1) modelling architectural variability at design-time using Common Variability Language (CVL), and (2) using a genetic algorithm that finds at run-time nearly-optimal configurations using the information provided by the variability model. We also specify a case study and we use it to evaluate our approach, showing that it is efficient and suitable for devices with scarce resources. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (22 refs)

Abstract: The core of the design of software architecture is all about architectural decision making. A high-quality design outcome sets high requirements, not only on the skills and knowledge of the design team members, but also on the management of the decision making process. We claim that in order to deliver high quality decisions, the design team needs to obtain a high level of situational awareness. To address this, we present an analysis of the problem of team situational awareness in design workshops and propose a model on how stakeholder positions help to build consensus within the argumentation viewpoint of architectural decisions. We show how the Software Architecture Warehouse tool has been extended to support the argumentation viewpoint within its live design document metaphor to provide support for co-located and distributed design workshops. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Big Data Management has become a critical task in many application systems, which usually rely on heavyweight batch processes to process large amounts of data. However, batch architectures are not an adequate choice for the design of real-time systems, where expected response times are several orders of magnitude underneath. This paper outlines the foundations for defining an architecture able to deal with such an scenario, fulfilling the specific needs of real-time systems which expose big RDF datasets. Our proposal (Solid) is a tiered architecture which separates the complexities of Big Data management from their real-time data generation and consumption. Big semantic data are stored and indexed in a compressed way following the Rdf/Hdt proposal; while at the same time, real-time requirements are addressed using NoSQL technology. Both are efficient layers, but their approaches are quite different and their combination is not easy. Two additional layers are required to achieve an overall high performance, satisfying real-time needs, and able to work even in a mobile context. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (16 refs)

Abstract: We propose to map functional system requirements, specified with SysML, directly into system architecture, by exploiting the composition relation between component interfaces. Our research challenge is to guarantee formally that the final system fulfill the set of all requirements. Our approach is based on component-based systems (CBS) specified with SysML models and Interface Automata (IA) to capture their behaviors. From a SysML Requirement Diagram (RD), we build a Block Definition Diagram (BDD) to specify system architecture, by taking, one by one, the lowest level of requirements. At each new added requirement, we add a new component satisfying this requirement, by the composition, in the partial architecture obtained in a precedent step. Then we verify whether the new component is compatible with the components in the partial architecture, and if the requirements are preserved. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (10 refs)

Abstract: Today, architectural component models are often used as a central view of architecture descriptions. So far, however, only a very few rigorous empirical studies relating to the use of component models in architectural descriptions of software systems have been conducted. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled experiment regarding the supportive effect of architectural component diagrams for design understandability. In particular, the goal of the experiment was to determine whether architectural component diagrams, provided in addition to a non-trivial software system�s source code, have a supportive effect on the ability of novice architects to answer design and architecture related questions about that system. Our study provides initial evidence that architectural component diagrams have a supportive effect for understanding the software design and architecture, if a direct link from the component diagram�s elements to the problem that requires understanding can be made. If such a direct link cannot be made, we found evidence that it should not be assumed that architectural component diagrams help in design understanding, for instance only by providing a big picture view or some general kind of orientation. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The architecture of cloud applications differs from traditional software architectures mainly regarding their basic architectural elements, the services, the metadata about the services for expressing information related to quality parameters and pricing models, and the constraints over the applications and the used services. This paper presents Cloud-ADL, a seamless extension of the ACME ADL to support the architectural representation of cloud applications by relying on the existing ACME abstractions. In addition, it defines contracts to modularly encapsulate typical contract information of cloud applications, such as quality parameters, pricing model of the services, and constraints. Finally, Cloud-ADL also supports the dynamic reconfiguration of cloud applications through programmed changes, which can be foreseen at design time and specified at the ADL level. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Software architecture erosion can reduce the quality of software systems significantly. It is hence of great importance to repair erosion efficiently, for example, by means of refactoring. However, existing refactoring approaches do not address architecture erosion holistically. In this paper, we describe the problem of optimally repairing software architecture erosion and investigate the applicability and limitations of current refactoring approaches. We argue that a heuristic search for adequate repairs using formalized and explicit knowledge of software engineers could overcome those limitations. This paper outlines an approach we have been starting to investigate in our recent research and also aims at stimulating a discussion about further research challenges in repairing software architecture erosion. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The software architecture of a system is often used to guide and constrain its implementation. While the code structure of an initial implementation is likely to conform to its intended architecture, its dynamic properties cannot be fully checked until deployment. Routine maintenance and changing requirements can also lead to a deployed system deviating from this architecture over time. Both static and dynamic checks are thus required to ensure that an implementation conforms to its prescriptive architecture throughout its lifespan. However, runtime conformance checking strategies typically alter the implementation of an application, increasing its size and affecting its performance and maintainability. In this paper, we describe the design of a novel dynamic conformance-checking framework that is pluggable and non-intrusive, thereby limiting any overheads to those periods when checking is activated. An implementation of this framework with Java as the target language and its early evaluation are also presented. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (14 refs)

Abstract: It is critical to analyze characteristics of real-time embedded systems, such as timing behavior, early in the development. In the automotive domain, EAST-ADL is a concrete example of the model-based approach for the architectural modeling of real-time systems. The Timing Augmented Description Language v2 (TADL2) allows for the specification of timing constraints on top of EAST-ADL models. In this paper we propose a formal validation & verification methodology for timing behaviors given with TADL2. The formal semantics of the timing constraints is given as a mapping to the Clock Constraint Specification Language (CCSL), a formal language that implements the MARTE Time Model. Based on such a mapping, the validation is carried out by the simulation of TADL2 specifications. The simulation allows for a rapid prototyping of TADL2 specifications. The verification is performed based on a TADL2 mapping to timed automata modeling using the Uppaal model-checker. The whole process is illustrated on a Brake-By-Wire application. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (20 refs)

Abstract: Architectural modeling using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can support the development of concurrent applications, but the problem of mapping the model to a concurrent implementation remains. This paper defines a scheme to map concurrent UML designs to a concurrent object-oriented program. Using the COMET method for the architectural design of concurrent object-oriented systems, each component and connector is annotated with a stereotype indicating its behavioral design pattern. For each of these patterns, a reference implementation is provided using SCOOP, a concurrent object-oriented programming model. Given the strong execution guarantees of the SCOOP model, which is free of data races by construction, this development method eliminates a source of intricate concurrent programming errors. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Quality attributes (QA) play a fundamental role when architecting software systems. However, in contrast to QA in traditional software systems, the role of QA when architecting service-based systems (SBS) has not yet been studied in depth. Thus, we conducted a descriptive survey to explore how QA are treated during the architecting of SBS. Data were collected using an online questionnaire targeted at participants with architecting experience. Our survey shows that QA and functional requirements of SBS are mostly considered equally important. Also, QA are usually treated explicitly rather than implicitly. Furthermore, dependability and performance appear to be the most important QA in the context of SBS. Our results partially show that general findings on QA also apply to the domain of SBS. On the other hand, we did not find a confirmation that QA are primary drivers for the architecting of SBS, or that certain application domains would focus on particular QA. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The architecture description of a software product line (SPL) is essential to make it clear how the architecture realizes the feature model and to represent both the domain and application engineering architectural artefacts. However, most architecture description languages (ADLs) for SPL have limited support regarding variability management and they do not express the relationship between features and the architecture, besides the lack of tools for graphical and textual modelling and a non-clear separation between the domain and application engineering activities. In order to overcome these deficiencies, this paper presents LightPL-ACME, an ADL whose main goal is to be a simple, lightweight language for the SPL architecture description, and enable the association between the architectural specification and the artefacts involved in the SPL development process, including the relationship with the feature model and the representation of both domain and application engineering elements. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: In the last decade, context-aware computing has become the central focus of the ubiquitous computing where computers disappear in the background of people�s everyday life activities. Context-aware adaptive systems are able to adapt themselves according to the gathered context information. In this context, many approaches have been proposed in order to model the former systems but only few of them tackle at the same time all the features of these systems. This paper presents a formal modeling approach based on Bigraphical Reactive Systems to deal with both the structural and behavioral aspects of context-aware adaptive systems. It provides a clear separation between the context-aware information that affect the system and the system itself. Indeed, we specify the context and the system using two distinct bigraphs, then we combine them using the bigraphs composition operation to represent the whole system. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: The development of a single software product is inefficient when groups of product are related since the development cost could be high. In addition, some products need to be self-adaptive in order to take into account the execution context changes. In this case, the implementation and management of the adaptation mechanisms variability is challenging especially for distributed systems due to the distribution issues. We address in this paper such issues by proposing a method for the software engineering of distributed adaptation systems. We propose an architectural model for distributed management of dynamic adaptation. We define also a graph grammar based approach to automate the tasks needed to construct and configure the adaptation system. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (3 refs)

Abstract: Motivation: The current literature in the architectural knowledge domain has made a significant contribution related to documenting software architectural decisions. However, not many studies have been conducted to assess the architectural decision-making and decision reuse processes through empirical investigations. Besides, the effect of the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem on the architectural decisions-making process of each actor is not well studied. Goal: The objective of this paper is to identify the main processes and issues on the architectural decision-making in largescale enterprises by considering the relationships among the enterprises and other actors of the ecosystem. Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with six Norwegian companies in the software ecosystem of electricity industry. Results: Regarding the architectural decision-making process, the findings are in line with previous empirical studies, showing that most of the companies are not using well-known academic approaches such as ATAM, they are rather using their own procedures. The study also shows that the relationships among the actors of a software ecosystem could significantly affect the architectural-decision making process in each of the actors, for example, by limiting their alternative solutions. Finally, the results confirm that it is advantageous for the enterprises to reuse the architectural decisions across their various projects or for cooperative companies to reuse the decisions across their similar projects. Conclusion: Improving the reusable architectural decision frameworks by considering the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem would be beneficial for the industry. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Architectural prototyping is a widely used practice, concerned with taking architectural decisions through experiments with lightweight implementations. However, many architectural decisions are only taken when systems are already (partially) implemented. This is problematic in the context of architectural prototyping since experiments with full systems are complex and expensive and thus architectural learning is hindered. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for harvesting architectural prototypes from existing systems, �architectural slicing�, based on dynamic program slicing. Given a system and a slicing criterion, architectural slicing produces an architectural prototype that contains the elements in the architecture that are dependent on the elements in the slicing criterion. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Modeling SOA design patterns with a standard formal notation avoids misunderstanding by software architects and helps endow design methods with refinement approaches for mastering system architectures complexity. In this paper, we propose a formal architecture-centric approach that aims to model message-oriented SOA design patterns with the SoaML standard language. Pattern models are developed in a stepwise manner which are then automatically translated into Event-B specifications that can be proved using the Rodin theorem prover. These two steps are performed before undertaking the effective coding of a design pattern providing correct by construction solutions. Our approach is experimented through pattern examples. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (12 refs)

Abstract: Architectural patterns are important artefacts containing specialized design knowledge to build good-quality systems. Complex systems often exhibit several architectural patterns in their design which leads to the need of architectural pattern composition. Unfortunately, information about the composition of patterns tend to be vaporized right after the composition process which causes problems of traceability and reconstructability of patterns. This paper proposes a pattern description language that first, facilitates several types of pattern merging operation and second, allows the traceability of pattern composition. More specifically, the approach consists of a proper description of pattern that supports composition operations and a two-step pattern design process that helps to preserve pattern composition information. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Much research exists on architectural decisions, but little work describes architectural decisions in the real-world. In this paper, we present the results of a survey with 43 architects from industry. We study characteristics of 86 real-world architectural decisions and factors that contribute to their difficulty. Also, we compare decisions made by junior architects and senior architects. Finally, we compare good and bad architectural decisions. Survey results indicate that architectural decisions take an average time of eight working days. Dependencies between decisions and the effort required to analyze decisions are major factors that contribute to their difficulty. Compared to senior architects, junior architects spend a quarter of the time on making a decision. Good architectural decisions tend to include more decision alternatives than bad decisions. Finally, we found that 86% of architectural decisions are group decisions. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (10 refs)

Abstract: Software architects are often forced to make design decisions based on limited information. In this paper, we present an approach that allows software architects to study information about design decisions made by hundreds or more software architects by automatically analyzing the version management data of large open-source repositories. The contribution is, first, that it develops a conceptual model to reason about the automatic derivation of specifically medium level architectural design decisions. Second, we show that it is indeed possible to derive these design decisions automatically from open source projects. This provides a basis for statistical and quantitative reasoning about software architecture design decisions that allows software architects to make better-informed decisions. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Engineering the upcoming generation of software systems and guaranteeing the required qualities is complex due to the inherent uncertainties at design time, such as new user needs and changing availability of resources. Architecture-based self-adaptation is a promising approach to tackle these challenges. In this approach, a system maintains a model of itself and adapts itself to realize particular quality objectives using a feedback loop. Despite a vast body of work, no systematic study has been performed on the claims associated with architecture-based self-adaptation and the evidence that exists for these claims. As such insight is important for researchers and engineers, we performed a systematic literature review covering 20 leading software engineering conferences and journals in the field, resulting in 121 studies used for data collection. The review shows that self-adaptation is primarily used to improve performance, reliability, and flexibility. The tradeoffs implied by self-adaptation have not received much attention, and evidence is mainly obtained from simple examples. From the study, we derive a number of recommendations for future research in architecture-based self-adaptive systems. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (18 refs)

Abstract: The amount of software in the automotive domain is steadily increasing. Existing functions are adapted or enhanced on a regular basis. Often, such adaptations do not allow to keep the interfaces of the concerned components stable, leading to incompatibilities with former systems. In this contribution, we propose an optimized adaptation software architecture to deal with mismatching interfaces. We extend existing middleware solutions with transparent adapter loading capabilities. This enables for seamless adapter integration on those systems. As adapter model we use a finite-state machine aside with a domain specific language. By extracting static adaptations from the state machine we achieve state reduction and performance gain. The approach is evaluated using an automotive case-study. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (16 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture provides a high-level design that serves as the basis for system implementation and communication among stakeholders. However, changes in requirements and lack of conformance checks during development can cause the implemented architecture to deviate from the intended one. Such architecture degradation can cause rapid software aging and high maintenance costs. Conformance checking to detect inconsistencies between a model and its corresponding implementation is one of the strategies used to minimise architecture degradation. Existing conformance checking tools often require formal architecture specifications, which are not usually available outwith academic settings, or manual intervention in the process, which affects their viability. This paper describes an automated approach that uses mappings between architecture models in UML and corresponding implementations in Java to check conformance. These notations have been chosen for their adoption in industry. A customisable tool called Card, which implements this approach, is also introduced and evaluated. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (25 refs)

Abstract: Support for capturing architectural knowledge has been identified as an important research challenge. As the basis for an approach for recovering design decisions and capturing their rationale we have performed an expert survey in practice to gain insights into the different kinds, influence factors, and sources for design decisions and also on how they are currently captured in practice. The survey has been performed with software architects, software team leads, and senior developers from six different companies in Austria with more than 10 years of experience in software development on average. The survey confirms earlier work by other authors on design decision classification and influence factors but also identifies additional kinds of decisions and influence factors not mentioned in this previous work. In addition, we gained insight into the practice of capturing, the relative importance of different decisions and influence factors, and on potential sources for recovering decisions. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Software architecture has become an established discipline in industry. Nevertheless, the available documentation of architecture is often not perceived as adequate by developers. As a foundation for the improvement of methods and tools around architecture documentation, we conducted a survey with 147 industrial participants, investigating their current problems and wishes for the future. Participants from different countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America shared their experiences. This paper presents the results of the survey. The results confirmed the common belief that architecture documentation is most frequently outdated and inconsistent and backed it up with data. Further, developers perceive difficulties with a �one-size-fits-all� architecture documentation, which does not adequately provide information for their specific task and context. Developers seek for more interactive ways of working with architecture documentation that allow finding needed information more easily with extended navigation and search possibilities. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: MVC is considered an important architectural patterns when it comes to interactive applications since its invention in the days of Smalltalk. However, interaction with computers has changed. Touch-screens are as natural to users nowadays as mouse and keyboard have been for the past decades of computing and HCI-researchers keep on developing more interaction modalities. Multimodal applications pose major challenges to software engineers who have to deal with different ways for users to express the same intention. MVC does not incorporate the flexibility needed to cope with multimodal applications as it makes the controller component responsible for interaction interpretation and managing the application flow. We propose MVIC, an extension to MVC dedicated to provide a solid software architecture for multimodal, interactive applications by introducing a dedicated interaction component. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: In recent years, the software architecture community has proposed to use architectural design decisions (ADDs) for capturing the design rationale and the architectural knowledge (AK). As software systems evolve both ADDs and architectural designs need to be documented and maintained. This is a tedious and time-consuming task because of the lack of systematic and automated support for bridging between ADDs and designs. As a result, decisions and designs become inconsistent over time. We propose to alleviate this problem by introducing an AK transformation language supporting reusable AK transformations from pattern-based ADDs to component-and-connector models. In addition, we devise reusable consistency checking rules for verifying the consistency between decisions and designs. Through the use of model-driven transformations, as well as reusable, pattern-based decision models, we ensure the reusability of our approach. We apply our approach in an industrial case study and show that it offers high reusability, is largely automated and scalable, and can deal with the complexity of large numbers of recurring decisions. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Reference architectures (RA) are reusable architectures for artifacts in a particular domain. They can serve as a basis for designing new architectures, but also as a means for quality control during system development. Quality control is performed through checking the conformance of systems in development to (company-wide) reference architectures. If performed manually, reference architecture conformance checking is a time- and resource-intensive process. In this paper we outline an approach for reference architecture conformance checking of application architectures in the banking domain. Reference architectures are defined on the basis of reusable rules, consisting of roles and of constraints on roles and role relationships. Conformance checking can be performed semi-automatically and continuously by automating important steps like the extraction of the actual application architecture, the binding of reference architecture roles to the elements of a specific application architecture, and the evaluation of the reference architecture rules for an application architecture. � 2013 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: With demands of speed in software development it is of interest to build on available software platforms that incorporate the necessary non-competitive functionalities and focus the development effort on adding features to a competitive product. This paper proposes that we move from an API-oriented focus and instead suggest four architectural concerns for describing software platforms as more relevant. � 2013 Springer-Verlag. (6 refs)
