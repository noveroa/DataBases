Abstract: Since 2004 in St. Andrews (Scotland, U.K.), ECSA the European Conference on Software Architecture (formerly EWSA, the European Workshop on Software Architecture) has been considered as an important meeting point for researchers and practitioners on the topic of software architecture. ECSA has matured from a workshop format to a full software engineering conference in the subfield of software architecture. This year, ECSA has become more ambitious and expanded its scope and schedule up to four full days. The program includes a series of tutorials, a doctoral mentoring program, and four full-day workshops. New and existing software challenges have led to a variety of trends in software architecture research, which makes the conference and workshops more attractive and promotes the discussion on current and emerging topics. Based on the scientific and technical interest of the topics, the innovativeness of workshop topics, and the capacity of the conference workshop program, the workshop co-chairs selected four workshops from the nine submitted proposals. We summarize the aims and goals of each workshop and the contributions accepted for the four workshops: &bull 2nd International Workshop on Software Ecosystems (EcoSys). Piers Campbell, Faheem Ahmed, Jan Bosch, Sliger Jansen. &bull 1st International Workshop on Measurability of Security in Software Architectures (MeSSa). Reijo Savola, Teemu Kranste�n, Antti Evesti. &bull 8th Nordic Workshop on Model Driven Software Engineering (NW-MODE). Andrzej Wasowski, Dragos Truscan, Ludwik Kuzniarz. &bull 1st International Workshop on Variability in Software Product Line Architectures (VARI-ARCH). Alexander Helleboogh, Paris Avgeriou, Nelis Boucke, Patryck Heymans. The ECSA 2010 Workshop co-chairs would like to thanks all workshop organizers for their effort and enthusiasm to attract submission in different software architecture research topics and make the ECSA 2010 workshops a success. � 2010 ACM.

Abstract: The paper proposes an Efficient Cluster-based Self-organisation Algorithm (ECSA) for partitioning Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) into clusters, thus giving at the network a hierarchical organisation. Each sensor uses its weight based on its k-density and its residual energy to elect a cluster-head in its 2-hop neighbourhood. ECSA operates without a centralised controller, and does not require that the location of sensors be known. Firstly, we estimate the number of clusters formed with ECSA according to transmission range, then we evaluate the amount of packets sent to the sink per energy dissipation by using the same model presented by Heinzelman et al. (2002), and the number of nodes alive per number of packets received at the sink. Simulation results illustrate that ECSA can evenly distribute energy consumption of sensors and consequently maximise network lifetime when compared to LEACH and LEACH-C. (22 refs)

Abstract: The nature of software engineering is changing. Whereas building systems was the predominant activity, more recently the focus has shifted toward composing systems from open-source, commercial and proprietary components and to only build the functionality that truly is competitively differentiating. In addition, the way software is developed has changed as well, especially focusing on short development cycles and frequent, or even continuous, deployment. Because of these requirements, often teams are organized around features, rather than components, and can change all components in the system, including their interfaces. A third trend is the increasing adoption of software ecosystems, where significant development of functionality relevant for customers occurs outside the platform organization. Obviously, however, the quality attributes that are necessary for system success remain important as well as the ability to easily incorporate new requirements in the system in a cost effective fashion. Because of the above, the role of software architecture and in particular the software architects is more important in this new world, but there is significant evolution in the implementation of the role. The paper starts by characterizing the new approach to software engineering and the role of compositionality. It then explores the implications for software architecture and the role of the software architect, Finally, it defines a number of research challenges for the ECSA community to explore. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: The Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA) emphasizes the role of project management, interdisciplinary projects, and other non-engineering skills that engineers inevitably will use in their careers. An excellent mechanism with which to achieve this goal is to use systems engineering and project management as teaching modules and in metacognitive fashion. This can be done in different ways, but a common thread is required over the period of the engineering course. As a result, students are exposed to engineering skills such as requirements analysis and management, specification practices, behavioral analysis, and project management. Systems engineering, when applied properly, draws together all aspects of engineering, including human, legal, economic, environmental, and other requirements, while project management draws together interpersonal skills. Ethics, entrepreneurship and other soft skills are taught under the same umbrella modules in order to show relevance that has previously been lacking. �2010 IEEE. (5 refs)

Abstract: Cloud computing, a new paradigm of distributed computing, introduces many new ideas, concepts, principals, technologies and architectural styles into enterprise service-oriented computing. The enterprise service-oriented architecture (ESOA) style is an abstraction of concrete enterprise service-orientated architectures, which includes SOA architectural elements, service design patterns as well as principles, and SOA quality attributes. It can be extended to a new style for realizing enterprise cloud computing. Meanwhile, the principles and style of enterprise service-oriented computing facilitate the enterprise-wide adoption of cloud computing. This paper extends the ESOA style to a new hybrid architectural style, Enterprise Cloud Service Architecture (ECSA). The style is described by extending enterprise service-oriented formula for ESOA. We model the style through specifying each element in the formula with both service-oriented and cloud architectural styles. � 2010 IEEE. (37 refs)

Abstract: A rigorous paradigm coordinating components is important in the design stage of large-scale software engineering. In this paper we propose a new Architecture Description Language, called ACDL, to represent the centralized-mode architectural connection in which all components are linked by a single connector. Following one usual approach to architectural description, in which component types and components are distinguished, and connectors integrate behaviors of components by specifying their coordination protocols, ACDL describes connectors in such a way that connectors are insensitive to the numbers of attached same-type components. Based on ACDL, we develop analytic techniques to facilitate the system checking of temporal properties of an architecture. In particular, our method shows to what extent one can add, delete and replace components without making the whole system lose desired temporal properties, and improves the system checking in several ways, for example enhancing the use of previous checking results to deal with new checking problems.

Abstract: Mapping elements from an application domain to architectural abstractions is a significant architecture description activity from the point of view of seamlessness in descriptions. For establishing such a mapping of domain elements to architectural abstractions, an approach based on ontological analysis is presented. The central idea of the approach is to establish the mapping through a uniform framework of understanding that is applicable over the problem domain as well as the solution domain. The reference ontology used is an adaptation of Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) ontology. Typically, an element from an application domain is mapped with an architectural abstraction when both represent the same phenomena from BWW ontology. The approach is realized as a model-driven transformation process. (18 refs)

Abstract: Building and maintaining non-trivial software systems that are independently extensible is a difficult task. This is because the combination of independent extensions tends to produce conflicts that are difficult to anticipate, and to which no general resolution strategy exists. In this paper, we show how some of these conflicts can be avoided if domain-specific contexts are modeled using a representation that is open for extension and safe for sharing among independent extensions. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Architecture definition requires architects who are highly qualified in both the use of architectural patterns and the analysis of the application�s requirements. This is because they have to identify what patterns satisfy the application�s functional requirements (FR) and quality attributes (QA), and the interrelationships between them. However, since QAs and FRs are usually addressed separately, their interrelationships are not detailed in full. This situation means that the architect has to expend considerable effort on their identification, with the risk of misinterpretations that lead to an inappropriate choice of patterns. We here present a model that allows the FRs to be marked with the constraints imposed by the QAs. The marks are conceived to be re-used during the architecture definition. The model brings knowledge of the requirements and their relationships closer to the architect, allowing patterns aligned with the requirements to be identified with less effort. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Service-oriented architecture is an architectural approach that can be applied for building autonomous service systems dynamically to satisfy on-demand business requests. During the execution of service compositions, architectural constraint violations relating to functional and non-fucntional system properties need to be handled intelligently and autonomously, possibly requiring architectural reconfigurations. We propose integrated architectural constraint violation handling to deal with architectural quality problems through dynamic reconfiguration. We concentrate on service replacement selection as a remedial strategy for a possible quality violation requiring architectural remedies. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (12 refs)

Abstract: Creating architecture for a complex telecommunication system is a difficult task and requires expertise of many different stakeholders. The software architecture design process relies on understanding the architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) for the system under design. This paper describes experiences in creating a new base station product line. A goal was to create a process to facilitate fulfillment of ASRs during the development of the product line. The approach proved to be feasible for developing large-scale systems in the telecommunications infrastructure domain. This paper describes the approach taken, experiences gathered during the development process and promotes the idea of defining concrete ASRs for each project and refining them through architecture for all relevant subsystems. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Architecture-based approaches for runtime evolution enable software systems to dynamically move between consistent architectural variants. Successful runtime evolution must enable the new, replacement variant to be initialized with the data of the replaced one. In distributed systems, however, the initialization is complex and may be time-consuming due to data transfers across sites. Identifying systems� components subject to change is then critical for planning evolution and reducing replacement actions, avoid unnecessary data transfers, and then, reduce downtime of system services. Addressing this issue, this paper presents an approach to runtime evolution of distributed applications. We present how a development process allows to 1) specify architectural variants of an application and 2) identify components subject to change and operations for transferring data managed by these components. Moreover, the design information is used at runtime to automatically plan evolution. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (19 refs)

Abstract: The ability of systems to adapt is increasingly seen as a necessary underlying capability for modern software systems. The resulting self-adaptive systems are not only supposed to cope with changes, but must also preserve their consistency. To deal with such challenges in a systematic way, the design of self-adaptive systems needs to be put on a formal basis. In this paper, we argue for the benefits of a formal yet extensible approach to behavioural adaptations of component-based system architectures. This approach provides the usage of alternative adaptation processes rather than being limited to a single one. The application of Coloured Petri Nets for modelling and analysing the adaptation processes proves to be useful to trust consistency preservation. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (14 refs)

Abstract: Reputation-Based Trust (RBT) model with embedded incentive mechanisms provides an accurate quantitative measurement for services choosing their partners based on fair ratings accumulated from users. These mechanisms stimulate services to offer ratings truthfully, otherwise they lose their gains or even receive penalties. However, leveraging such mechanisms in distributed environments is a challenging task by its centralized nature. In this paper, we propose a new architecture development that combines relevant architectural components to make trust systems highly scalable with the auction mechanisms� capability to prevent lie. In this architecture we define an auction-based trust negotiation protocol that guides the interactions of distributed services and realize it in the distributed trust framework. Our architecture scales efficiently for increasing numbers of services interacting with the system, while still achieving protection against untruthful incentives even when a majority of ratings are unfair. An example of a supply chain is devised with empirical evidence collected. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (18 refs)

Abstract: This paper presents extension of MDA called Context-aware Quality Model Driven Architecture (CQ-MDA) which can be used for quality control in pervasive computing environments. The proposed CQ-MDA approach based on ContextualArchRQMM (Contextual ARCHitecture Quality Requirement MetaModel), being an extension to the MDA, allows for considering quality and resources-awareness while conducting the design process. The main idea of presented extension consists in three abstractions levels: PIM (Platform Independent Model), CPIM (Contextual Platform Independent Model) and CPSM (Contextual Platform Specific Model). At the PIM level, a model decomposed into a two interrelated models: software architecture artifacts, which reflect functional requirements and quality model. At the CPIM level a simultaneous transformation of these two models with contextual information details is elaborated and then refined to a specific platform at the CPSM level. Such a procedure ensures that the transformation decisions should be based on the quality assessment of the created models. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (15 refs)

Abstract: It has been proposed to make architectural design decisions first-class entities in software architecture representation. The actual means of capturing, representing, and managing architectural design decisions is still an open issue of research. We present an approach for capturing requirements and design decisions during design and development. We integrate design decisions, requirements, scenarios, and their relationships along with other architectural elements directly in a single, consistent, and formally defined architecture model. Capturing, visualizing, and tracing of architectural knowledge are supported by an integrated set of tools working on this model. The approach supports comprehensive tracing between requirements, design decisions, other architectural elements, and implementation artifacts, impact analysis, and architecture analysis and evaluation. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Architecture-centric software generation has the potential to support flexible design and large-scale reuse. This paper describes the development of an architecture-centric framework that consists of multiple architecture alternatives, from which the architect can select and generate a working prototype in a top-down manner through a user interface rather than building it from scratch. The framework is primarily built with well-understood design patterns in distributed and concurrent computing. The development process involves extensive domain analysis, variability management, and bottom-up component engineering effort. The framework enables the architect or designer to effectively conduct upfront software architecture analysis and/or rapid architectural prototyping. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Modern middleware platforms provide the applications deployed on top of them with facilities for their adaptation. However, the level of adaptation support provided by the state-of-the-art middleware solutions is often limited to dynamically loading and off-loading of software components. Therefore, it is left to the application developers to handle the details of change such that the system�s consistency is not jeopardized. In this paper, we present an approach that addresses the current shortcomings by utilizing the information encoded in a software system�s architectural style. This information drives the development of adaptation patterns, which could be employed to enhance the adaptation support in middleware platforms. The patterns specify both the exact sequence of changes and the time at which those changes need to occur. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (10 refs)

Abstract: This paper introduces a classification for decisions originating from work performed by architects. With the creation of a new architecture, all observed decisions were documented using an existing taxonomy extended with the introduced classification. In the first four months, 80 decisions were documented. Not all decisions have the same value for the architecture and one needed a classification to reason about importance of decisions. After realization of the first increment of the architecture a sanity check was performed: The architects showed how the six most important design artefacts and the fifteen most important architectural constraints and prerequisites were related. The relationship was via decisions and the classification helps to reduce the work to make and maintain this connection over time. The classification is dynamic and over time decisions can be classified differently. This enables architectural learning by pointing out which decisions were taken too early or had little impact. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (8 refs)

Abstract: Due to the lack of both precise definitions and effective software engineering methodologies, security principles are often neglected by software architects, resulting in potentially high-risk threats to the systems. This work lays the formal foundations for the understanding of the least privilege (LP) principle in software architectures and provides a technique to identify LP violations.

Abstract: Benefits of scenario-based software architecture evaluation such as ATAM are widely recognized. However, full-scale software architecture evaluation is resource and time consuming. In this paper we propose a technique to facilitate the creation of scenarios in a particular domain using a conceptual model especially targeted for architecture evaluation. The technique supports the finding of general, system-independent scenarios and the use of general scenarios in new evaluations. If the model is annotated with a (domain-specific) pattern language, the approach also supports the identification of solutions and the analysis of the architecture. The potential benefits of the technique in terms of semi-automatically produced scenarios are analyzed in the context of an industrial architecture evaluation. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Explaining and motivating architectural choices are crucial points both in real system development and in computer scientists education. Stakeholders and students should fully understand from a high level perspective the rationale behind basic architectural choices. The paper proposes a communication approach that is complementary to established design processes and can be exploited in workshops that involve the �non-architects� at the end of each phase of an iterative development process. Starting from a problem analysis focused on the significant aspects of data, activities and information flows, a logical architecture is defined by grouping activities into logical components. Different logical architectures are rated according to several conceptual dimensions, in order to highlight their specific rationale and benefits. Finally, deployment solutions are considered to weight the ratings according to costs and constraints of different deployment architectures and of the underlying technologies. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: With software services becoming a strategic capability for the software sector, software architecture needs to address integration problems to help services to collaborate and coordinate their activities. The increasing need to address dynamic and automated changes can be answered by a service coordination architecture with event-based collaboration that enables dynamic and adaptive architectures. Intelligent service and process identification and adaptation techniques are suitable solutions for event-driven and on-demand service architectures. We define an architectural solution space and identify research challenges. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (10 refs)

Abstract: Software structuring techniques aim to make software systems easier to develop and maintain, increasing their quality. Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) and Software Architectural Styles are examples of such techniques. In spite of all the benefits of structuring techniques, both actual and intended, it is not always easy or even advantageous to integrate two or more of these techniques. For example, the effects of combining AOSD and Layered Software Architectures are still not well understood. This might be detrimental to system quality and can be a decisive factor when deciding whether or not to employ AOSD, specially considering the pervasiveness of layered architectures. This paper presents a study aiming to assess the impact of AOSD on software architectures adopting the layered style. To better account for the influence of aspects on the layered structure of the system, we have extended existing approaches to measure dependencies and layering violations in software architectures. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the experience of refactoring the architecture of Ginga, the Brazilian Terrestrial Digital TV System (SBTVD) middleware. The main goal of the Ginga refactoring was to increase its configurability, through the automatic management of its variabilities. The resultant middleware, named GingaForAll, is based on a software product line (SPL) architecture, which encompasses both the middleware commonalities and its specific functionalities. Aspect-oriented techniques were used to improve the modularization of crosscutting mandatory and variable features from the Ginga SPL architecture. A model-driven based process was developed to allow the automatic management of the common and variable features in a high abstraction level that supports the management of code assets in terms of configurable models. The integration of such software engineering techniques have contributed to provide a flexible and configurable Ginga architecture, which allows the automatic generation of middleware customizations driven by the devices constraints and applications needs. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: I report on the activities and research challenges, their rationales, and the work in progress related to the ongoing EPSRC/UoB Bridging the Gap Fellowship project on Green Cloud Architectures. The initiative is aimed at a framework for dynamic self-optimization of cloud architectures taking into account the tradeoffs involved in maintaining acceptable dependability requirements/ Quality of Service (QoS) with minimal power at runtime. I argue that linkage between dependability requirements and power should be explicit. I motivate the need for new meters for Power-per-QoS value (and sacrifices) for cloud architectures. I motivate the need for an economics-inspired approach for dynamic self-optimization of cloud architectures. I discuss the role of Data Driven Simulation Systems in implementing such framework. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (4 refs)

Abstract: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has received increasing attention by providing low coupling, reuse, productivity, and a better understanding of the business domain. However, there are challenges in creating quality solutions using services. Based on SOA, reference models and reference architectures have been proposed to support the understanding, development, and standardization in the development of service-oriented systems. Considering the relevance of SOA, as well as the lack of a complete panorama about these models and architectures, this paper aims at presenting a detailed view about the establishment and use of these models and architectures. For this, we conducted a systematic review. As main results, we observed a recent increase in the number of work regarding reference models and reference architectures based on SOA, including for different domains. Furthermore, based on the presented view, we identified interesting and important perspectives for future research. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (7 refs)

Abstract: Software systems need software architectures to improve their scalability and maintenance. However, many agile practitioners claim that the upfront design of software architectures is an investment that does not pay off, since customers can rarely appreciate the value delivered by architectures. Furthermore, conventional architectural practices may be considered unacceptable from the Agile values and principles perspective. In this paper, the development of working architectures in agile iterations is presented as an attempt to solve the problem of designing software architectures in Agile. This contribution is based on the new concept of Plastic Partial Component (PPC). PPCs are highly malleable components that can be partially described, what increases the flexibility of architecture design. PPCs based architectures let reinforce some of the agile values and principles. Our experience of putting this contribution into practice is illustrated through the agile development of a Testing Framework for Biogas Plants. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (32 refs)

Abstract: Numerous design decisions are made in model-based software development which often are not documented explicitly. Hence, the design knowledge is �in the designers mind� and communicated orally, if at all, and the rationale behind the decisions is lost. Existing tools tackle this problem for architectural decisions which refer to the higher level architecture of a system. However, these decisions are separate artifacts and not linked to individual design model elements. Hence, there is no automatic check whether the design models comply with made decisions. This paper presents concepts for explicitly linking design decisions and design model elements. As first class artifacts, design decisions can be used for documentation, consistency checking, and reuse. In case consistency constraints are violated, the user is notified that the design models no longer comply with the decisions made. Reuse is realized by extracting design model changes as reusable patterns for recurring decisions. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (22 refs)

Abstract: Dynamic service discovery is one of the main concepts which define the Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). This mechanism ensures loosely coupled services. It supports the reusability of services and the flexibility of applications. This paper provides a new service discovery approach which enhances the number of services potentially discovered and thus, it multiplies the number of candidate services. This multiplication ensures a better selection of the most suitable services and more alternatives is case of failures. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (11 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel technique for assessing and prioritizing architectural quality in large-scale software development projects. The technique can be applied with relatively little effort by software architects and thus suited for agile development in which quality attributes can be assessed and prioritized, e.g., within each development sprint. We outline the processes and metrics embodied in the technique, and report initial experiences on the benefits and liabilities. In conclusion, the technique is considered valuable and a viable tool, and has benefits in an architectural, technical, context, as well as in a business and people context. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Quality goals have to be under a special consideration during software architectural design. Evolvability constitutes a quality goal with a special relevance for business critical systems. Architectural patterns can significantly contribute to the satisfaction of quality goals. But architectural design decisions regarding these goals have to be made in a systematic, methodical way and concerning the patterns� influence on quality properties. Unfortunately, pattern catalogs do not well support quality goal-oriented design decisions. This paper presents a systematic refinement and mapping of the quality goal evolvability to properties for good architectural design. A set of architectural patterns is evaluated regarding these properties. Furthermore, a calculation scheme is provided that enables the evaluation of the patterns to support design decisions. The results have been developed, revised, and evaluated in a series of applications based on industrial expertise. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (35 refs)

Abstract: Architecture-centric, component-based development intensively reuses components from repositories. Such development processes produce architecture definitions, using architecture description languages (Adls). This paper proposes a three step process. Architecture specifications first capture abstract and ideal architectures imagined by architects to meet requirements. Specifications do not describe complete component types but only component roles (usages). Architecture configurations then capture implementation decisions, as the architects select specific component classes from the repository to implement component roles. Finally, architecture assemblies define how components instances are created and initialized to customize the deployment of architectures in their own execution contexts. This development process is supported by a three-level Adl which enables the separate definition of these three representations. The refinement relationships between these architecture representations are also discussed. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (16 refs)

Abstract: In Software Product Lines variability refers to the definition and utilization of differences between several products. Feature Diagrams (FD) are a well-known approach to express variability, and can be used to automate the derivation process. Nevertheless, this may be highly complex due to possible interactions between selected features and the artifacts realizing them. Deriving concrete products typically involves the composition of such inter-dependent software artifacts. This paper presents a feature-based composition approach to automatically derive a product architecture from a given feature configuration. The proposed approach relies on the combination of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM) techniques. We introduce a metamodel to reify each feature as a high-level aspect model. Product derivation is achieved by weaving the set of aspect models corresponding to a particular feature configuration. The weaving strategy is derived from an in-depth cross-analysis of both the feature interactions and the aspect model dependencies. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (22 refs)

Abstract: A Software Product Line (SPL) is a family of related software systems distinguished by the different sets of features each system provides. Over the last decade, the substantial benefits of SPL practices have been extensively documented and corroborated both in academia and industry. Several architecture methods have been proposed that employ different artifacts for expressing the components of a SPL, their properties and relationships. Of crucial importance for any SPL architecture method is to guarantee that the variability, for instance as expressed in feature models, is not only preserved but also kept consistent across all artifacts used. In this research challenge paper we argue that Safe Composition - the guarantee that all programs of a product line are type safe - can be leveraged to address this guarantee for structural properties of SPL architectures and the challenges that that entails. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: With current trends towards moving variability from hardware to software, and given the increasing desire to postpone design decisions as much as is economically feasible, managing the variability from requirements elicitation to implementation is becoming a primary business requirement in the product line engineering process. One of the main challenges in variability management is the visualization and management of industry size variability models. In this demonstration, we introduce our CASE tool, MUSA. MUSA is designed around our work on multiple perspective variability modeling and is implemented using the state-of-the-art in NUI, multi-touch interfaces, giving it the power and flexibility to create and manage large-scale variability models with relative ease. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Software architecture may go through many changes during its existence. Architecture evaluation can point out current problems, help to anticipate some of the future changes, and also show the absolute limits of a design. This paper presents experiences from eleven scenario based architecture evaluations with ATAM. The evaluations were completed on a tight two day evaluation schedule. This limited time forced to search for alternative scheduling options. The evaluated system designs had relatively long life cycle up to 30 years and all the designs were evaluated for the first time. We have learnt that in evaluations current issues often overshadow the long view of the future. We suggest that architecture evaluations should be integrated to the development process as a tool not only for today but also for tomorrow. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (13 refs)

Abstract: Telecom service development process followed at Orange consists of a sequence of interrelated tasks. We present an MDA tool which describes this process using SPEM 2.0 compatible graphical editor, and then associates a model to each defined task for its execution. These models are validated for conformance to functional rules embedded inside the tool. Task automation is achieved using MDA model transformations, which use Orange knowledge model as the basis to extract the existing reusable functional components and their interdependencies. Graphical editor and model transformations have been integrated together in an ECLIPSE environment. Finally, the validated functional design model is transformed towards a UML2 profile, so as the telecom architect can manipulate it in an environment he is familiar. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: A key objective for ubiquitous environments is to enable system interoperability between system�s components that are highly heterogeneous. In particular, the challenge is to embed in the system architecture the necessary support to cope with behavioral diversity in order to allow components to coordinate and communicate. In this paper we present the design building blocks for the dynamic and on-the-fly interoperability between heterogeneous components. Specifically, we describe an Architectural Pattern called Mediating Connector, that is the key enabler for communication. In addition, we present a set of Basic Mediator Patterns, that describe the basic mismatches which can occur when components try to interact, and their corresponding solutions. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Architecture recovery aims at providing a high level abstraction of a system using the architectural elements to represent functionalities and interactions. This architecture makes easier the program comprehension and then provides many advantages during all the phases of software life cycle. Nevertheless, most architecture recovery approaches fail to combine the human expertise on the system with a high automation level. In order to solve this issue, we propose to use the intentional architecture of a system, which represent the system as imagined by its designers, to improve the adequation between the resulting software architecture and the architect�s expectations without requiring more human expertise. Thus, we present in this paper a semi-automatic process to recover intentional architecture from the available documentation and the expert recommendations. This process is an extension of ROMANTIC, an approach aiming at recovering a component-based architecture of an existing object-oriented system. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (18 refs)

Abstract: Automating sophisticated, personalized expert activities, which are based on the application of professional knowledge to process an individual case, remains a great challenge. It is all the more relevant in some complex domains such as preventive medicine or e-learning where reliable and self-adaptive solutions are expected by users. In this paper we analyze differences between typical procedure-based business processes automation and expert activities automation. We propose to integrate context related knowledge into the business process modeling via the development of an intelligent process management agent. The latter is designed to dynamically orchestrate the set of services that will build up the process reproducing an expert activity, adapted to the concrete client�s context. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Software architecture represents a significant intellectual asset. But much of the architectural knowledge in organizations is still tacit knowledge. Different parties involved in software development have different needs in terms of architecture at different point in time, not limited to the architects themselves. How can we deliver the right information at the right time to the right person, as schedules are compressed? And where would the information be coming from? And how good is it? Various strategies have been tried, from central, bureaucratic accumulation of data-codification strategies, to simply giving access to the right person-personalization strategies, and a few hybrid strategies in between. This goes beyond mere software documentation, we need to effectively support the reasoning of the architects and developers. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (5 refs)

Abstract: The loose coupling notion associated with the service composition is a key concept which defines the Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) paradigm. Given that this notion is intuitively understood, its definition lacks formalism. Moreover, the existing evaluation metrics are limited and cannot take into account all the specificities of the SOA�s composition mechanism. In this paper, we present a set of metrics based on a clear definition of the loose coupling. We combine these metrics in a formula which calculates a weight. This weight allows for clear measurements of a composite�s coupling. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (21 refs)

Abstract: One of the major advantages of component-based software engineering is the ability for developers to reuse and assemble software entities to build complex software. Whereas decomposition of software into components has been and is largely addressed for what concerns the business (functional) part of applications, this is not yet the case for what concerns their documentation (non-functional) part. In this paper, we propose a new and original solution to express componentbased software non-functional documentation, and we will focus more especially on architecture constraints, which formalize parts of architecture decisions, as executable, customizable, reusable and composable building blocks represented by components. Component-based applications using business and constraint components can be modeled with CLACS, a dedicated ADL which is also introduced in the paper. Architecture constraints can be executed at design-time within CLACS. CLACS is implemented as a plugin in the Eclipse IDE. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (7 refs)

Abstract: The importance of modelling the dynamic architectural characteristics of software systems has long been recognised. However, the nature of the dynamic architectural characteristics of service-oriented applications goes beyond what is currently addressed by existing architecture description languages (ADLs). At the heart of the service-oriented approach is the logical separation of service need from the need-fulfillment mechanism, i.e., the service provider: the binding between the two is deferred to runtime and established at the instance level, i.e. each time the need for the service emerges. In this paper we present an architecture-oriented model for dynamic reconfiguration that paves the way for the definition of ADLs that are able to address the specification of dynamic architectural characteristics of service-oriented applications. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Software architecting entails making architecture decisions, which requires a lot of experience and expertise. Current literature contains several methods and processes to support architects with architecture design, documentation and evaluation but not with the design reasoning involved in decision-making. In order to derive a systematic reasoning process we need to understand the current state of practice and propose ways to improve it. In this paper we present the results of a survey that was conducted with undergraduate software engineering students, aiming to find out the innate reasoning process during architecting. The results of the survey are compared to the existing architecture literature in order to identify promising directions towards systematic reasoning processes. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Despite of ongoing development of model-driven development approaches in industry and academia, we believe that in particular for business logic aspects of information systems there is a lack of integrated support considering all phases of a model driven software process, from analysis until code generation. In our work we developed a framework consisting of meta-models, model transformations and tools that address a consistent support of development and maintenance tasks. As contribution of this article, we present an architecture for generated business logic code as part our infrastructure blueprint. We aim at the generation of robust business logic layers and consider particularly maintenance and integration issues of complex information systems with external dependencies. For this purpose, our infrastructure supports the specification of global domain states and local conditions in visual software models and generates corresponding code artifacts which assure these conditions automatically. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Although a lot of research has been carried out on the technical architecture of software systems, the domain of Functional Architecture in the software product industry lacks a formalization of the related concepts and practices. Functional Architecture Modeling is essential for identifying the functionalities of the software product and translating them into modules, which interact with each other or with third party products. Furthermore, the Functional Architecture serves as a base for mapping the functional requirements and planning the product releases. In this paper, we present the Functional Architecture Diagrams, a powerful modeling tool for the Functional Architecture of software products, which comprises: a modular decomposition of the product functionality; a simple notation for easy comprehension by non-specialists; and applicability in any line of business, offering a uniform method for modeling the functionalities of software products. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: One of the main advantages of the Web component-based development paradigm is the ability to build customizable and composable web application modules as independent units of development, and to share them with other developers by publishing them in libraries as COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) or free components. Besides this, since many years, Web services confirmed their status of the most pertinent solution for a given service provider, like Google, Amazon or FedEx, to open its solutions for third party development. In this paper, we present an approach to build web services starting from existing web component-based applications and deploy them on a web service provider. This transformation helps server-side web application developers in transforming their �user interface�-based web components into a set of web services intended for remote code extensions. We implemented our solution on a collection of Java EE technologies. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (8 refs)

Abstract: The main challenge of software engineering has always been to bring software complexity under control. Different kinds of abstractions have been devised and applied for that purpose at different levels of software design. Some of them have proven successful, such as function hierarchies, layers, API�s, abstract classes, encapsulation, interfaces etc. and are widely used in practice. Concepts from the genre of software architecture should also help to manage software complexity. We argue that, before architecture decisions and architecture decision-making become a common industrial practice, they have to support software complexity management much more efficiently than at present. Despite the substantial progress already made, it is still a major challenge both in theory (architecture decisions representation and architecture decision-making methods) and practice (tool support). � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The software architect�s communicative action is often conducted face-to-face, e.g. in presentations and workshops. A software architecture documentation as a carrier of explicit architectural knowledge can also be seen as an architect�s communicative action. This perspective opens the door for treating a software architecture documentation as an expression of an asynchronous knowledge communication process enabling the application of principles from communication theory. In this paper this perspective is taken and specific requirements are derived for software architecture knowledge management tools with respect to the context-oriented communication model. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Managing embedded systems complexity and scalability is one of the most important problems in software development. To better address this problem, it is very recommended to have an abstraction level high enough to model complex systems. Architectural description languages (ADLs) intend to model these systems and manage their structure at a high abstraction level. Traditional ADLs do not provide appropriate formalisms to separate any kind of crosscutting concerns. This frequently results in poor descriptions of the software architectures and a tedious adaptation to constantly changing user requirements and specifications. AOSD (Aspect Oriented Software Development) deals with these problems by considering crosscutting concerns in software development. The effectiveness of AOSD appears when aspect concepts are considered throughout the software�s life-cycle. In this paper, we propose a new aspect language called AO4AADL that adequately manipulates aspect oriented concepts at the software architecture level to master complexity and ensure scalability. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Abstract: Architectural patterns are often combined with other, relevant architectural patterns during software architecture design. However, combining patterns effectively remains a challenging task: first because the integration of any two architectural patterns can take several forms; second because existing pattern languages only mention generic pattern-to-pattern relationships and do not go into the details of their combination. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by discovering and defining a handful of recurring pattern relationships at the level of the participants of patterns. We have studied 32 industrial case studies and mined a number of relationships between participants of different patterns. We present a few of these relationships and outline some examples of their appearance. � 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. (7 refs)

Abstract: Measurement of any complex, operational system is challenging due to the continuous independent evolution of the components. Security risks introduce another dimension of dynamicity, reflected to risk management and security assurance activities. The availability of different measurements and their properties will vary during the overall system lifecycle. To be useful, a measurement framework in this context needs to be able to adapt to both the changes in the target of measurement and in the available measurement infrastructure. In this study, we introduce a taxonomy-based approach for relating the available and attainable measurements to the measurement requirements of security assurance plans by providing an Abstraction Layer that makes it easier to manage these dynamic features. The introduced approach is investigated in terms of a security assurance case example of firewall functionality in a Push E-mail service system. � 2010 ACM. (21 refs)

Abstract: The Service-Oriented Architecture paradigm (SOA) is commonly applied for the implementation of complex, distributed business processes. The service-oriented approach promises higher flexibility, interoperability and reusability of the IT infrastructure. However, evaluating the quality attribute security of large and complex SOA configurations is not sufficiently mastered yet. To tackle this complex problem, we developed a method for evaluating the security of existing service-oriented systems on the architectural level. The method is based on recovering security-relevant facts about the system by using reverse engineering techniques and subsequently providing automated support for further interactive security analysis at the structural level. By using generic, system-independent indicators and a knowledge base, the method is not limited to a specific programming language or technology. Therefore, we are able to apply the method to various systems and adapt it to specific evaluation needs. The paper describes the general structure of the method, and presents an instantiation aligned to the Service Component Architecture (SCA) specification. � 2010 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: Originally, meta-models were used to specify the structure (abstract syntax) of modelling languages. This is reflected both in meta-languages like MOF and Ecore, and the four-layer meta-model architecture. Presently, meta-modelling is used for specification of complete languages. In this situation, it turns out that the traditional meta-languages are not always expressive enough to capture all language aspects. This usually implies the use of more than one metalanguage in the meta-model architecture to cover the different language aspects. There are many approaches to address this challenge. In this paper, we analyze these approaches, and based on this analysis, we re-think the meta-model architecture focusing on complete language specifications. In our meta-model architecture, each aspect of a language conforms to an aspect-specific meta-language at the level above, and models can reside at different levels depending on their context and use. This meta-model architecture is easier to understand, more flexible and more extensible; therefore it may be useful in the design of meta-model-based language specification platforms, as well as for promoting the understanding of the principles of meta-modelling. � 2010 ACM.

Abstract: Software Product Lines are typically used to support development of a software product family and not a software product population, which denotes a broader and more diverse range of software products. We present a Software Product Line Infrastructure (SPLI) that has been designed to increase the reuse of software efforts in product populations. The SPLI takes a bottom-up approach by structuring product features in highly reusable software components called Active Components which contain different types of artefacts. Variability is expressed using domain-specific models and formal variability models. Variability is bound during product derivation by executing model-to-artefact transformations. Components are active because they are invoked during the derivation process, thereby empowering the component. The SPLI enables step-wise refinements of applications by allowing specialization and composition of models before variability is bound. A prototype of the SPLI has been created that was used to develop and evaluate an experimental software product line. It is concluded that within the context of our experimental software product line the SPLI improves software reuse in software product populations. � 2010 ACM. (25 refs)

Abstract: Smart spaces are dynamic environments for sharing information e.g. in personal, building, or public networks. Key challenges for smart spaces include security and interoperability between heterogeneous devices, from high-end PCs to embedded gadgets and sensors. We propose a novel security architecture, which enables heterogeneous devices to share data in controlled manner. Centralized information brokering device is used to measure security level of published information. These measurements are then used to authorize information access. Hence, the architecture enables devices to share information with the same security level even when these devices do not have interoperable security protocols. We propose policy configuration and deployment models, which are feasible and usable with embedded devices. We also describe our practical experiences from implementing the proposed security solution for smart spaces. � 2010 ACM. (32 refs)

Abstract: The treatment of economic and social issues in Software Engineering (SE) was pointed out as a challenge for the next years, since SE needs to treat issues beyond the technical side, which requires observing it in another perspective. In this sense, this paper revisits the concept of components in SE through a sociotechnical construction. Based on a ranking of its critical elements, a study shows that components are assets in a set of collaborative/local environments more than in global/corporate markets. So, an approach called Brecho�-VCM was proposed to treat some of these elements, providing an environment to discuss the future of Software Reuse on a software ecosystem perspective. These analyses, as well as their results, reinforce that SE community needs to learn with the components case and effectively looks at SE future in a sociotechnical way. � 2010 ACM. (37 refs)

Abstract: Successful software products and product lines exhibit a force of gravity that attracts external developers. The organization developing the product actively seeks to involve external developers to add functionality to the system. On the other hand, external developers flock to a successful product as it provides an established market where underserved niches provide a business opportunity for these players. The product or product line evolves into a platform for external developers. This causes several software architecture challenges for a software ecosystem, including interface stability, evolution management, guaranteeing security and reliability and composition of independently developed functionality. The paper describes these challenges, discusses practical solutions and identifies research challenges. � 2010 ACM. (1 refs)

Abstract: This article, presents a comparison of a first generation software quality assessment model (OpenBRR) and a second generation model (QualOSS) by applying them to the case of Asterisk, a FLOSS implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX, VoIP). The key trend in the evolution of FLOSS quality assessment models is the movement from manual and descriptive to more automated and analytical models, and from the involvement of a few metrics to hundreds of metrics. Concerning the security measurements, they are much more sophisticated in QualOSS than in OpenBRR. Where OpenBRR have only three security metrics, QualOSS has nine security indicator with altogether 30-40 security metrics. This article shows how security are measured in the two assessment models, putting it into the overall context of the two approaches. � 2010 ACM. (18 refs)

Abstract: Integrating Commercial Off-The-Shelf products in a company�s software product portfolio offers business value, but introduces challenges from a software architecture perspective. In this paper, the research challenges in relation to identity management in the Danish municipality administration system called Opus, are outlined. Opus BRS is the identity management part of Opus. Opus integrates SAP, legacy mainframe systems, and other third party systems of the individual municipality. Each of these systems define their own software architecture and access control model, leading to architectural mismatch with an impact on security, usability, and maintainability. The research project is discussed and access control and identity provisioning are recognized as the major areas of interest in relation to the mismatch challenges. The project is carried out in close cooperation with KMD, one of the largest Danish IT companies, which is the producer of the Opus BRS system. Lastly, a status of the project is given and the next steps of the research are outlined. � 2010 ACM. (15 refs)

Abstract: An embedded software system is reconfigurable when it can modify its behavior or its architecture. The reconfigurations are launched according to the evolution of context requirements and the variation of execution environment constraints. In this paper we focus our attention on design model level with two-fold purposes. Firstly, building modeling tools to help specify and configure reconfigurability issues; and secondly validating our modeling by its integration in a Model-Based Development Approach. The contribution exhibits meta-model to deal with reconfiguration component based applications in DRTES at a model level. The elements of this meta-model will be used to describe software specifications and requirements, using component as a first class artifact to build such systems. To capture reconfiguration concepts, we introduce the notion of metamodes as a generic set of modes with a specific links between them. By doing so, the reconfiguration activities between metamodes are user-specified and the reconfiguration action between modes will be generated automatically. Within this development process, component application and reconfiguration properties are declaratively specified at model level and are transparent for the component implementation. An application is then described using UML and specialized extensions: MARTE profiles from the OMG and our proposal. As a proof of concept, we examine a test case that has reconfiguration requirements: a GPS. � 2010 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: Software platform developers do not have insight into the consequences of architectural decisions made in regards to openness, while openness determines whether and how third-party developers adopt the software platform. For mobile communication devices, however, the adoption by third-party developers is essential for the growth of an ecosystem, which has proven to be a successful strategy for mobile communication device ecosystems. In this research the openness and architectures of five mobile platforms are compared, to provide further insight into successful openness strategies for software ecosystem growth. � 2010 ACM.

Abstract: Presently, no methods exist that support the creation process of an industry taxonomy within a specific domain. Without such a method, taxonomies remain erroneous, making the development of, for instance, a directory of companies for research, extremely hard. This paper presents a method for creating complete and encompassing domain specific taxonomies. With such a method, researchers can create complete, consistent, taxonomies that in turn provide a strong basis for data model development. The method is applied in practice, and the industry taxonomy is evaluated by practitioners. � 2010 ACM. (33 refs)

Abstract: Many approaches to interface development apply only to isolated aspects of the development of user interfaces (UIs), e.g., exploration during the early phases, design of visual appearance, or implementation in some technology. In this paper we explore an integrated approach to incorporate the whole UI development life cycle, connect all stakeholders involved, and support a wide range of levels of granularity and abstraction. This is achieved by using Window/Event-Diagrams (WEDs), a UI specification notation based on UML 2 state machines. It affords closer collaboration between different user groups like graphic designers and software developers by integrating traditional pen-and-paper based methods with contemporary MDA-based CASE tools. We have implemented our approach in the Advanced Interaction Design Environemnt (AIDE), an application to support WEDs. � 2010 ACM. (27 refs)

Abstract: Currently, architectural knowledge management focuses mostly on the explicit representation of knowledge, under the codification strategy. Due to its limitations, recent research favors a hybrid approach, combining the codification and personalization strategies. In this paper, we argue that tacit architectural knowledge can help solve this problem. We propose to investigate the knowledge conversion processes of internalization and socialization and their real world impact. � 2010 ACM. (9 refs)

Abstract: The concept of a Software ecosystem is gaining in popularity amongst large organizations and inherently relies on the adoption of common architectural development for multiple product development. The adoption of these approaches represents a significant shift in traditional software development style and process methodology. Currently several organizations are in practice with this new process model which embraces business, third party involvement and open architecture as its central pillars and these institutions have thrived as a result. The advent of software ecosystems have caused major players in the software industry to rethink their operating practices and engage with third parties, opening their platforms to external entities to attain business objectives. In this paper we present a three dimensional view of the software ecosystem model examine the role played by each of the three central pillars; business; architecture; and social aspects. We further highlight their relationships and conclude that this study will help in further aiding understanding of the overall engineering process of ecosystem software. � 2010 ACM. (10 refs)

Abstract: Security metrics are the tools for providing correct and up-to-date information about a state of security. This information is essential for managing security efficiently. Although a number of security metrics were proposed we still need reliable ways for assessment of security. First of all, we do not have a widely-accepted and unambiguous definition which defines what it means that one system is more secure than another one. Without this knowledge we cannot show that a metric really measures security. Second, there is no a universal formal model for all metrics which can be used for rigourous analysis. In this paper we investigate how we can define �more secure� relation and propose our basic formal model for a description and analysis of security metrics. � 2010 ACM. (25 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Risk Identification Method based on Value Chain Dynamics Toolkit (VCDT) and apply it to a Risk Analysis of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) in a simple host-server scenario. The HIP Risk Analysis revealed no new risks inherent to the protocol itself. A number of potential risks in a typical deployment were identified. These risks should be analyzed and mitigated in the actual HIP deployment. The new Risk Identification method provided benefits, particularly in the knowledge transfer, structuring of the interviews and visualization of the value chain. Further study is needed on how to cover trust- and privacy aspects, how to improve ease of documentation and how to proceed from risk identification to security testing. � 2010 ACM. (20 refs)

Abstract: The use of the term ecosystem in the context of extensible software platforms and third-party developers or user communities has made us ponder about the similarities between software ecosystems and natural ecosystems. We therefore compare software ecosystems and natural ecosystems to present an agenda for further research by analyzing some key characteristics of both types of ecosystems. We discuss the regulatory factors and mechanisms existing in nature, and then deduce key challenges that need to be dealt with, in order to achieve healthy operation of software ecosystems. � 2010 ACM.

Abstract: Space and time are common high-level concepts in several classes of systems, however they seldom are first class concerns at the software architecture level. In particular they have a crucial role in responsive environments, i.e. technology-augmented ordinary environments which are able to sense and respond to their inhabitants. The paper presents the Ph.D. proposal of the author, which aims to define suitable architectural abstractions to manage space and time in responsive environments. The paper first outlines the problem, then presents the related work and finally describes the proposed solution approach, the expected results and their validation plan. � 2010 ACM. (24 refs)

Abstract: The management of variability in software product lines goes beyond the definition of variations, traceability and configurations. It involves a lot of assumptions about the variability and related models, which are made by the stakeholders all over the product line but almost never handled explicitly. In order to better manage the design with variability, we must consider the rationale behind its specification. In this paper we present a model for the specification of variability design rationale and its application to the modelling of architectural variability in software product lines. � 2010 ACM.

Abstract: Several architectures for autonomic systems have been proposed in the past decade. In this research challenge paper, we briefly discuss them with an emphasize on their robustness and scalability. We propose a two-layer autonomic architecture where the global management functions are carried out by a self-organizing feedback loop inspired by the behavior of ant colonies and expect it to be robust and scalable. The proposed architecture is sustained with examples from our past work as well as our plans for future research. � 2010 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: We describe ongoing work on a variability mechanism for Autonomic Software Product Lines (ASPL). The autonomic software product lines have self-management characteristics that make product line instances more resilient to context changes and some aspects of product line evolution. Instances sense the context, selects and bind the best component variants to variation-points at run-time. The variability mechanism we describe is composed of a profile guided dispatch based on off-line and on-line training processes. Together they form a simple, yet powerful variability mechanism that continuously learns, which variants to bind given the current context and system goals. � 2010 ACM. (26 refs)

Abstract: Many companies developing embedded systems and software as part of a product line struggle with how to improve their architecting practices to deal with increasing complexity. As the amount of legacy systems from previous products increases, the architecting becomes more and more evolutionary. This paper develops a process maturity model for evolutionary architecting, that can be used by an organization to improve its practices. The model is based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) which is instantiated to suit the architecting needs. Through this instantiation and simplification, it becomes feasible also for a small architecting team to systematically improve its maturity without dealing with the full CMMI. It is shown how the resulting maturity model addresses a number of issues previously collected from industrial case studies. The method is evaluated by performing maturity evaluations at several companies. � 2010 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: Service-oriented architectures are a standard-based and technology-independent distributed computing paradigm for discovering, binding and assembling loosely-coupled software services. Software product lines on the other hand allow a generic architecture to be configured and deployed in different instances. Product lines facilitate systematic reuse through managing variability. In this paper, we combine ideas from the service domain and the product line domain and investigate what types of variability exist in service-oriented software architectures. Moreover, we suggest a way for representing variability in service-oriented architectures by formalizing the notion of variability. To allow different viewpoints on variability, we define stakeholder roles that occur in the context of service-oriented software architectures. By applying the proposed concepts, we hope to improve variability management at the software architecture level of service-oriented systems. � 2010 ACM. (18 refs)

Abstract: Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) are the means to define the software architecture of a complex system. ADLs are strongly related to stakeholder concerns: they must capture all design decisions fundamental for system�s stakeholders. Stakeholder concerns are various and ever evolving, thus it is impossible to capture all system�s concerns with a single ADL. The evolution of a concern may cause the used ADLs (or even the whole architecture framework) not to fit any more with the system-of-interest. In this work we propose an approach for describing software architectures with multiple and evolving stakeholder concerns. Under this perspective, the proposed approach allows (i) to define customized ADLs depending on the concerns held by the system�s stakeholders, (ii) to provide interoperability between either customized and already existing ADLs, (iii) to realize architecture frameworks in which viewpoints, views and languages are set up depending on the system�s stakeholders concerns. The approach is based on model-driven engineering technologies. � 2010 ACM. (14 refs)

However, these distinct yet related concepts are often substituted for one another in our discussions on securing trustworthy systems and services. This is damaging since it leads to imprecise security and trust requirements. Consequently, this results in poorly defined metrics for evaluating system security. This paper proposes a trust-terms ontology, which maps out and defines the various components and concepts that comprise ICT security and trust. We can use this ontology tool to gain a better understanding of their trust and security requirements and, hence, to identify more precise measurability criteria. � 2010 ACM. (21 refs)

Abstract: Today�s complex communication systems are vital for many businesses. The high skill needed to master those systems has created an economy of services where many specialised organisations participate in producing the end service. Managing that orchestra to produce the right functionality is a challenge in itself, but managing the security of the process can be difficult. In this paper, we discuss of the big picture of managing the security of such complex systems, of the gaps between some point solutions, and of the research needs we have identified, focusing on technical aspects of security. We think that coherently measuring various technical aspects of security and sharing the information wisely is the key to a satisfying solution. � 2010 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: Traditional software modeling tools are rigid and formal. There is no support for, e.g. freeform sketching that does not conform to the used meta-model, and hence, a lot of the actual modeling work gets done with other methods. Modeling tools are used merely for documenting the work later on, which is not economical. There is a need for flexible modeling tools that support the modeling in earlier phases of the work by allowing more freeform and informal descriptions as a part of the model. Tools like spreadsheets, word processing tools, and vector graphics tools are commonly used in software development. In this paper, we consider an approach where such a tool is enhanced with modeling support, in order to gain better support for the actual modeling work. We also show how we have created a graphical repository based case tool by using Microsoft Visio, and conclude the approach to be practical. � 2010 ACM. (28 refs)

Abstract: Code clones are a substantial problem for code based development; it is not surprising that model clones are a problem for model based development, too. Past experience with model version control vs. code version control suggests, however, that there are radically different problems and techniques on the code level than on the model level. In this paper, we explore the problems and possibilities associated with detecting clones in UML domain models. In particular, we have designed a number of algorithms and heuristics to detect clones, and have implemented them in the MQlone tool (read as �m clone�). However, all of the approaches we have studied so far have their weak spots, so that we cannot present a universal solution. Further work is required to refine and combine the approaches studied here, and test them on larger populations of models. While the related work faces similar unsolved problems our approach is the first one to deal with UML as a whole rather than with Matlab/Simulink or individual UML model types. � 2010 ACM. (24 refs)

Abstract: This paper proposes a research challenge to narrow the gap between the architecture and implementation of a software system. We discuss the situation today, where little of a system�s architecture and design is directly represented in the source code of its implementation and explore why this is a problem and the benefits that might flow from narrowing this gap. We then discuss how the situation could be improved by the creation of technologies that allow the design and architecture of a system to be directly related to its source code and outline the requirements that we believe that any such technology would need to fulfill. Finally, we consider the likely results of widespread application of such a technology and the benefits that would follow. � 2010 ACM. (10 refs)

Abstract: Security is an important quality attribute for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based system. However, there is no sufficient support for modelling security-centric concerns for SOA based application. This paper presents a metamodel called SoaML4Security, which introduces QoS concepts into Service oriented Modelling Language (SoaML) in order to support the modelling of security aspect. We motivate the need of extending SoaML for modelling security concerns from different viewpoints. We describe the process of developing the metamodel, which can support Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach for service-oriented applications. The use of the extended metamodel has been demonstrated by modelling a real world service-oriented application for security requirements. � 2010 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: This paper presents an approach that considers variation in systems and system architectures according to the kind of relation among the variants in the software family. The approach highlights why it is beneficial to consider such different variation relations separately and gives examples of what these relations may be. Two main categories of variation relations are presented, based on whether the system architecture remains constant (architecture-based variation), or whether the architecture itself is variable, i.e. the variants do not share a common architecture. The paper introduces several different kinds of variation families that seem to belong to these two categories, as well as yet other families comprising variants that do not neatly fit in either category, with only a subset of the variants sharing a common architecture. Each kind of variation relation is illustrated with an example software family from different domains, including operating systems (OS). � 2010 ACM. (25 refs)

Abstract: Architectural level analysis of a software system for its quality attributes is a proven cost-effective approach. This is particularly significant for performance, which defines multiple aspects of the quality of the system. In this paper we outline the contribution of a PhD, which provides architecture viewpoint based modeling and analysis support for parallelism and flow latency aspects of the performance, in legacy systems. The main contribution of the PhD includes Parallelism Viewpoint and Flow Latency Viewpoint. We use the proposed viewpoints to find parallelism and flow latencies specific performance bottlenecks of an industrial case, a precision critical electron microscope software system. The preliminary results of using Parallelism Viewpoint for our example case show that the viewpoint provides a profound insight into the thread-model of the system, which helps in reducing the excessively used parallelism in the system. � 2010 ACM.

Abstract: The process of web service composition involves different partner web services that are published over the internet. The Representational-State Transfer (REST) web services adopt different architectural style compared to Remote Procedure Call (RPC) web services. In this paper, we address these differences in the context of web service compositions and motivate the need for new designing techniques that lead to RESTful interfaces. We provide a UML based modeling approach for the composition of RESTful web services that models the composition for its static and behavioral features. These models provide RESTful compositions by construction, serve as a part of specification document, have mapping to several web implementation languages and can also be used to validate a RESTful composition. We illustrate the applicability of the approach with a sample Hotel and Flight booking RESTful composite web service. � 2010 ACM. (19 refs)

Abstract: The exploration of online social ecosystems whose members share mutual recommendations and interactions is a time-dependent and contextual-based process which aims to predict the social status among them. To address the difficulties associated with the process, this article presents the integration of the predictive recommender, social networks, and interaction components into a single methodology. The originality of the proposed framework stems from developing each model based on: (1) a time history and decay algorithm to consider temporal recommendations and interactions; (2) a predictive-aggregating function for different types of social contexts; and, (3) a homophily algorithm to evaluate people�s interconnections proximity. Details of the framework are described, a recommender search strategy methodology integrating all of the above is devised, and a case study is used to demonstrate its capabilities. Possible extensions are then outlined. � 2010 ACM. (15 refs)

Abstract: Software Ecosystems (SECOs) have in recent years emerged as a promising approach for improved inter and intra organizational reuse and for reusability involving end-users in the software development process. Understanding the software�s role in a larger perspective and how it interconnects with stakeholders is key for progress in those directions. However, for SECOs, several theoretical and methodological gaps remain to be charted. This paper identifies one such gap, the need for precise process modeling. It elaborates on experiences gained from the analysis of a SECO for mobile learning and brings up several aspects and insights for this particular domain. The main contributions are an initial reference model for the mobile learning domain and an outline for an analysis method for domain specific SECOs. � 2010 ACM. (18 refs)

Abstract: View/Viewpoint approaches like IEEE 1471-2000, or Kruchten�s 4+1-view model are used to structure software architectures at a high level of granularity. While research has focused on architectural languages and with consistency between multiple views, practical questions such as the structuring at a lower level of detail have not been dealt with. This paper aims at filling this gap by reporting personal experiences from a very large scale industrial domain modeling project. There, structuring the logical view turned out to be a critical success factor. We explain the project and its setting, analyze the role and repercussions of model structuring, and examine the implications model structuring decisions have on other parts of the project. We then explain the model structure abstracted from a very large scale industrial modeling project. Finally, we discuss lessons learned. � 2010 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: Software companies and organizations increasingly open up their business to other software companies and as a consequence they find themselves in an ecosystem of software companies, developers and partners. These actors, and especially the software organization that is at the core of this ecosystem, are having difficulties in getting insight into this ecosystem and how their actions influence its performance. In this paper a model is presented that describes the key characteristics of a Software Ecosystem. The central hub of a Software Ecosystem can use data on these characteristics to its strategic advantage. This is demonstrated by the use of the model in a case study of a hub in a software ecosystem. � 2010 ACM. (23 refs)

Abstract: During development of complex products, such as automotive software, models - formal and informal - are used throughout the development process by different roles and for different purposes - as requirement, as implementation or as documentation. This paper reports results from a case-study of the development of embedded software at a Swedish vehicle manufacturer. We investigated use of models from high-level product planning to low-level requirements specifications for software components. Furthermore, we investigated the distribution of effort among the models, requirements and other artefacts. The goal was to explore the spectrum of modelling techniques, methods and languages used and to establish a baseline for comparison with the state-of-the-art and other companies. The results show that there exist at least 8 different modelling notations. Moreover, we found that the majority of effort was spent on behaviour models, while static models - such as high-level design and requirements - were considered most important. � 2010 ACM. (22 refs)

Abstract: Software ecosystems are emerging as an alternative approach for the development of complex software systems. The potentially transformational benefits of software ecosystems stems, primarily, from two basic principles that software ecosystems have embraced: transparency, a pillar in open source development, and modular system design. Despite the benefits associated with transparency and modularity, there are also important challenges that deserve attention. In this paper, we introduce the concept of interface translucence as an architectural mechanism that seeks to overcome challenges faced by transparency and modular system design. Interface translucence leverages the important technical role that interfaces play in software architectures to bridge the technical and socio-organizational dimensions of software development in ecosystems. We present an application of the concept of interface translucence in the context of architecting a software system as well as in the context of implementing it. We conclude with a discussion of future research work. � 2010 ACM. (48 refs)

Abstract: Normally, software development practices concentrate to take all security requirements into account at design-time. Nevertheless, today�s software products are intended to be used in mobile, or alternatively, in embedded devices whose environment changes during the application�s execution. These kinds of changes occur especially in applications used in smart spaces. This enforces to think security concerns more dynamically. Thus, software has to be aware of its 1) security level in each time, and 2) changes in its environment that can cause security threats. Based on this awareness, software has to change its security mechanisms to fulfil security requirements in the current context. A security measurement is a key factor of this awareness. This work presents a micro-architecture for security adaptation and taxonomy of context information affecting to information security in smart spaces. The security measurement is the essential part of the micro-architecture. In addition, taxonomy describes concepts that have to be monitored in the smart space environment. � 2010 ACM. (25 refs)

Abstract: To facilitate the improved use of a software architecture document (AD), architectural information it contains needs to be structured into and/or presented as chunks: groupings of related information. The focus of our study is on the identification and creation of useful chunks of architectural information in ADs and the development of support tools to create and use this knowledge. We anticipate this will help stakeholders locate required architectural information facilitating its (re-)use. The main approach employed in this study is to capture and save users� AD exploration paths and related metadata, analyzing the exploration paths to find common patterns that serve as potential chunks of architectural information and using them to improve software ADs and documentation tool. Ultimately, this research aims to achieve user-driven chunking of architectural information in AD, to support information searching and better understanding of AD. � 2010 ACM. (35 refs)

Abstract: The ecosystem for a software product line includes all of the entities with which the software product line organization interacts. Information, artifacts, customers, money and products move among these entities as a part of the planning, development, and deployment processes. In this paper we present an analysis technique that uses the economic notion of a transaction to examine the transfers between the entities. The result of the analysis is data that is used to evaluate and structure the organization. We illustrate with an example. � 2010 ACM. (10 refs)

Abstract: A lack of security metrics signifies that it is not possible to measure the success of security policies, mechanisms and implementations, and security cannot, in turn, be improved if it cannot be measured. The importance of the use of metrics to obtain security quality is thus widely accepted. However, the definition of security metrics concerns a discipline which is still in its first stages of development, meaning that few documented resources or works centring on this subject exist to date. In this paper we shall therefore study the latest existing models with which to define security metrics and their components as aspects that have a bearing on the quality of software products with the intention that this will serve as a basis for continued advancement in research into this area of knowledge. � 2010 ACM.
