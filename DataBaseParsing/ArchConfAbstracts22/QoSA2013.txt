Abstract: In automotive industry, more and more complex electronics and software systems are being developed to enable the innovation and to decrease costs. Besides the complex multimedia, comfort, and safety systems of conventional vehicles, automotive companies are required to develop more and more complex engine, aftertreatment, and energy management systems for their (hybrid) electric vehicles to reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions. MATLAB/Simulink is one of the most popular graphical modeling languages and a simulation tool for validating and testing control software systems. Due to the increasing complexity and size of Simulink models of automotive software systems, it has become a necessity to maintain the Simulink models. In this paper, we defined metrics for assessing the modularity of Simulink models. A Java tool developed to measure the defined metrics on Simulink models interfaces with a visualization tool to facilitate the maintenance tasks of the Simulink models. The modularity metrics is furthermore validated in two phases. In the first phase, the modularity measurement is validated against the experts evaluation of a system. In the second phase, we studied the relationship between metric values and number of faults. We have observed that high coupling metric values frequently correspond to number of faults. Modularity metrics will be extended to architectural quality metrics for automotive systems. Copyright 2013 ACM. (54 refs)

Abstract: Since conventional software security approaches are often manually developed and statically deployed, they are no longer sufficient against today�s sophisticated and evolving cyber security threats. This has motivated the development of self-protecting software that is capable of detecting security threats and mitigating them through runtime adaptation techniques. In this paper, we argue for an architecture-based self-protection (ABSP) approach to address this challenge. In ABSP, detection and mitigation of security threats are informed by an architectural representation of the running system, maintained at runtime. With this approach, it is possible to reason about the impact of a potential security breach on the system, assess the overall security posture of the system, and achieve defense in depth. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present several architecture adaptation patterns that provide reusable detection and mitigation strategies against well-known web application security threats. Finally, we describe our ongoing work in realizing these patterns on top of Rainbow, an existing architecture-based adaptation framework. Copyright 2013 ACM. (33 refs)

Abstract: Software service emulation is an emerging technique for creating realistic executable models of server-side behaviour and is particularly useful in quality assurance: replicating production-like conditions for large-scale enterprise software systems. This allows performance engineers to mimic very large numbers of servers and/or provide a means of controlling dependencies on diverse third-party systems. Previous approaches to service emulation rely on manual definition of interaction behaviour requiring significant human effort. They also rely on either a system expert or documentation of system protocol and behaviour, neither of which are necessarily available. We present a novel method of automatically building client-server and server-server interaction models of complex software systems directly from interaction trace data, utilising longest common subsequence matching and field substitution algorithms. We evaluate our method against two common application-layer protocols: LDAP and SOAP. The results show that without explicit knowledge of the protocol specifications, our generated service models can produce well-formed responses for interactions. These responses can then be used within an emulation framework for large-scale enterprise system quality assurance purposes. Copyright 2013 ACM. (25 refs)

Abstract: Performance analysis is often conducted before achieving full knowledge of a software system, in other words under a certain degree of uncertainty. Uncertainty is particularly critical in the performance domain when it relates to values of parameters such as workload, operational profile, resource demand of services, service time of hardware devices, etc. The goal of this paper is to explicitly consider uncertainty in the performance modelling and analysis process. In particular, we use probabilistic formulation of parameter uncertainties and present a Monte Carlo simulation-based approach to systematically assess the robustness of an architectural model despite its uncertainty. In case of unsatisfactory results, we introduce refactoring actions aimed at generating new software architectural models that better tolerate the uncertainty of parameters. The proposed approach is illustrated on a case study from the e-Health domain. Copyright 2013 ACM. (23 refs)

Abstract: Software product lines (SPL) are a well-known concept to efficiently develop product variants. However, migrating customised product copies to a product line is still a labour-intensive challenge due to the required comprehension of differences among the implementations and SPL design decisions. Most existing SPL approaches are focused on forward engineering. Only few aim to handle SPL evolution, but even those lack support of variability reverse engineering, which is necessary for migrating product copies to a product line. In this paper, we present our continued concept on using component architecture information to enhance a variability reverse engineering process. Including this information particularly improves the difference identification as well as the variation point analysis and -aggregation steps. We show how the concept can be applied by providing an illustrating example. Copyright 2013 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: Self-adaptation allows continuously running software systems to operate in changing and uncertain contexts while meeting their requirements in a broad range of contexts, e.g., from low to high load situations. As a consequence, requirements for self-adaptive systems are more complex than requirements for static systems as they have to explicitly address properties of the self-adaptation layer. While approaches exist in the literature to capture this new type of requirements formally, their achievement cannot be analyzed in early design phases yet. In this paper, we apply RELAX to formally specify non-functional requirements for self-adaptive systems. We then apply our model-based SimuLizar approach for a semi-automatic analysis to test whether the self-adaptation layer ensures that these nonfunctional requirements are met. We evaluate our approach on the design of a proof-of-concept load balancer system. As this evaluation demonstrates, we can iteratively improve our system design by improving unsatisfactory self-adaption rules. Copyright 2013 ACM. (23 refs)

Abstract: Managing Quality of Service (QoS) of Service-based systems is a key challenge to produce systems that fulfill their requirements. Verifying the respect of a QoS contract in a system becomes more and more difficult as systems are more and more complex. Moreover, systems have to evolve in order to fulfil constantly changing requirements. As QoS properties are influenced by hidden factors such as connection rate or the system execution itself, determining the cause of a performance degradation is not mainstream. We propose in this paper to identify the causal relations to make explicit the hidden factors of influence. We more specifically focus on the consequences of system evolution with respect to QoS properties: using causal relations, we aim at predicting the possible overhead caused by an evolution. This paper shows through an example of Business Process how our evolution analysis helps to understand the effect of evolution on QoS property such as the Response Time. We show its efficiency by comparing the prediction with measured values. Copyright 2013 ACM. (23 refs)

Abstract: Context: A system of systems is an assemblage of components which individually may be regarded as systems, and which possesses the additional properties that the constituent systems are operationally independent, and are managerially independent. Much has been published about the field of systems of systems by researchers and practitioners, often with the assertion that the system-of-systems design context necessitates the use of architecture approaches that are somewhat different from system-level architecture. However, no systematic review has been conducted to provide an extensive overview of system of systems architecture research. Objective: This paper presents such a systematic review. The objective of this review is to classify and provide a thematic analysis of the reported results in system of systems architecture. Method: The primary studies for the systematic review were identified using a predefined search strategy followed by an extensive manual selection process. Results: We found the primary studies published in a large number of venues, mostly domain-oriented, with no obvious center of a research community of practice. The field seems to be maturing more slowly than other software technologies: Most reported results described individuals or teams working in apparent isolation to develop solutions to particular system-of-systems architecture problems, with no techniques gaining widespread adoption. Conclusions: A comprehensive research agenda for this field should be developed, and further studies should be performed to determine whether the information system-related problems of system of systems architecture are covered by existing software architecture knowledge, and if not, to develop general methods for system-of-systems architecture.

Abstract: In order to recover software architecture, various clustering techniques have been created to automatically partition a software system into meaningful subsystems. While these techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness, we observe that a key feature within most software systems has not been fully exploited: most well-designed systems follow strong architectural design rules that split the overall system into modules. These design rules are often manifested as special program constructs, such as shared data structures or abstract interfaces, which should not belong to any of the subordinate modules. We contribute a new perspective of architecture recovery based on this rationale, which enables the combination of design-rule-based clustering with other clustering techniques, as well as enabling the splitting of a large system into subsystems. We evaluated our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively, using both open source and real industrial software projects. Copyright 2013 ACM. (33 refs)

Abstract: Security in personal devices like mobile phones, tablets, is a major concern because these devices often carry sensitive information. Device platforms (e.g. Android) implement �limit access� and �authorize� security tactics to protect privacy/security-sensitive resources against misuse by an app. For instance, Android defines a set of 100+ permissions that guard resources such as phonebook data, network sockets and so on. However, due to poor understanding of these complex permissions, users inadvertently grant dangerous permissions to the apps, which defeat the security tactics implemented. Thus, security of a device is directly related to the capabilities granted to the intruder (app in this case). In this paper, we define a new quality attribute (QA) called Intrusiveness of an app, which characterizes the capabilities of an app to cause violation of personal and operational information of the user/device. We suggest a framework to compute �in-trusiveness� on a given platform. Intrusiveness of an app is represented as a 4-tuple. This tuple characterizes the extent to which the permissions, that are being sought by an app, could compromise in 4 dimensions of information, viz. User, Device, Carrier and the External World. It helps the user to realize the nature of privacy-sensitive resources that (s)he is exposing to the app. Efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by examining intrusiveness of 814 most popular free apps on Android. The Intrusiveness QA could be used to compute potential violation of User Personal Privacy, User Locational Privacy and violation of Device Integrity. Our analysis shows that 84% of apps examined are in a position to compromise User Personal Privacy, 96% can comprise Device Integrity and 92% can compromise Locational Privacy. Copyright 2013 ACM.

Abstract: Although an intensive research attention has been paid to software evolution, there is no established approach which supports a software development and evolution round-trip between requirements, design decisions, architectural elements, and code. The ADVERT approach shall provide support for software evolution on an architectural level. ADVERT is based on two core ideas: (1) Maintaining trace links between requirements, design decisions, and architecture elements, and (2) explicitly integrating software architecture information into the code. The expected benefits of the approach are: (1) Eased understanding of the relationship between requirements and design, and (2) assured compliance between architectural design and implementation. In this position paper we explain our envisioned approach and demonstrate it on a CoCoME-based example, which is a benchmark for component-based modelling approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM. (20 refs)

Abstract: We present a semi-automated approach and framework for cost-aware recovery from service inconsistency arising due to unreliable service actions. A range of costs such as time are parameterised and modelled generically using cost algebras. With respect to a user-provided business specification, we distinguish end-state consistency, which must be achieved at service completion, from strong consistency, which may be momentarily violated. Our approach ensures optimal end-state consistency for services where action failure may lead to temporary violations of strong consistency or endstate consistency. Enterprises could not otherwise optimally and dynamically handle strong consistency violation, especially with respect to a variety of costs. Our approach provides quantitative analysis by defining a service model as an high-level message sequence chart (hMSC), annotating service actions with costs, then interpreting the model as a weighted (Mazurkiewicz) trace language, catering for costs in the presence of true concurrency. We devise a framework and method which checks such a model and ensures service end-state consistency optimally by concatenating the traces of recovery strategies (expressed by MSCs) from an enterprise service repository. We evaluate our approach using a popular online shop case study. Copyright 2013 ACM. (44 refs)

Abstract: Outages to the cloud infrastructures have been widely publicized and it would be easy to conclude that application developers only need to be concerned with large scale cloud provider infrastructure outages. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In-cloud applications heavily rely on cloud infrastructure APIs (directly or indirectly through scripts and consoles) for many sporadic activities such as deployment change, scaling out/in, backup, recovery and migration. Failures and/or issues around API calls are a large source of faults that could lead to application failures, especially during sporadic activities. Infrastructure outages can also be greatly exacerbated by API-related issues. In this paper we present an empirical study of issues in Amazon EC2 APIs. Some of the major findings around API issues include: 1) A majority (60%) of the cases of API failures are related to �stuck� API calls or unresponsive API calls. 2) A significant portion (12%) of the cases of API failures are about slow responsive API calls. 3) 19% of the cases of API failures are related to the output issues of API calls, including failed calls with unclear error messages, as well as missing output, wrong output, and unexpected output of API calls. 4) There are 9% cases of API failures reporting that their calls (performing some actions and expecting a state change) were pending for a certain time and then returned to the original state without informing the caller properly or the calls were reported to be successful first but failed later. We also classify the causes of API issues and discuss the impact of API issues on application architectures. Copyright � ACM. (28 refs)

Abstract: The notion of technical debt attracts significant attention, especially in the context of reconciling architecture and agile development. However, most work on technical debt is still largely informal and if it provides a formalization it is often ad-hoc. In this paper, we provide a detailed, formal analysis of decision making on technical debt in development. Using this formalization, we show that optimal decision making is not effectively computable in real-world situations and provide several well-defined approximations that allow to handle the problem nevertheless in practical situations. Combining these approximations in a single method leads to a light-weight approach that can be effectively applied in iterative software development, including agile approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.

Abstract: In general, software architecture is documented using software architecture views to address the different stakeholder concerns. The current trend recognizes that the set of viewpoints should not be fixed but multiple viewpoints might be introduced instead to design and document the software architecture. To ensure the quality of the software architecture various software architecture evaluation approaches have been introduced. In addition several documentation guidelines have been provided to ensure the quality of the software architecture document. Unfortunately, the evaluation of the adopted viewpoints that are used to design and document the software architecture has not been considered explicitly. If the architectural viewpoints are not well-defined then implicitly this will have an impact on the quality of the design and the documentation of the software architecture. We present an evaluation framework for assessing existing or newly defined software architecture viewpoint languages. The approach is based on software language engineering techniques, and considers each viewpoint as a metamodel. The approach does not assume a particular architecture framework and can be applied to existing or newly defined viewpoint languages. We illustrate our approach for modeling and reviewing the first and second editions of the viewpoint languages of the Views and Beyond approach. Copyright � ACM. (38 refs)

Abstract: For developing software systems it is crucial to consider nonfunctional properties already in an early development stage to guarantee that the system will satisfy its non-functional requirements. Following the model-based engineering paradigm facilitates an early analysis of non-functional properties of the system being developed based on the elaborated design models. Although UML is widely used in modelbased engineering, it is not suitable for model-based analysis directly due to its lack of formal semantics. Thus, current model-based analysis approaches transform UML models into formal languages dedicated for analyses purpose, which may introduce accidental complexity of implementing the required model transformations. The recently introduced fUML standard provides a formal semantics of a subset of UML enabling the execution of UML models. In this paper, we show how fUML can be utilized for analyzing UML models directly without having to transform them. We present a reusable framework for performing model-based analyses leveraging execution traces of UML models and integrating UML profiles heretofore unsupported by fUML. A case study in the performance analysis domain is used to illustrate the benefits of our framework. Copyright 2013 ACM. (19 refs)

Abstract: Electric vehicles embed a low amount of energy, so their devices need to be managed efficiently to optimize the vehicle autonomy. A vehicle management is achieved by the embedded systems, modeled following the Autosar standard. Autosar covers most of the automotive concerns, but it lacks energy consumption and user-oriented Quality of Service models. This paper presents Orqa, a framework to model and manage the electric vehicle devices through energy consumption and user-oriented Quality of Service. At design time, the architects choose and tune the actual vehicle device models through their power requirements and, if appropriate, quality levels. The generated implementation is then embedded in the existing Autosar models. Thus, at run-time, the vehicle�s system is able to evaluate the global consumption of a trip and to propose the user a specific driving strategy. The optional devices are managed throughout the trip, based on the driver preferences. Orqa is illustrated with a classic use-case: a work to home trip. Copyright 2013 ACM. (17 refs)

Abstract: Software design patterns are proven solutions for recurring design problems. Decisions on the use of a pattern in a software design form a specific but important class of design decisions. However, despite their importance, these design decisions are often mistaken and rarely documented. In our survey, about 90% of the participants confirmed to have experienced such problems. Therefore, we propose an approach that supports the appropriate use of design patterns and documentation of such decisions. The main idea is to create a pattern catalogue, where a pattern (as part of its catalogue entry) is annotated with general questions on the appropriateness of the use of the pattern. The envisioned benefits of this approach are a more appropriate use of design patterns, and documented design decisions on the use of patterns with positive effects on evolution. In this paper, we present the enriched pattern catalogue, and results of a survey with 21 software engineers as a validation of some entries of the pattern catalogue. Copyright 2013 ACM. (30 refs)
