Abstract: For two years, we have been involved in a challenging project to develop a new architecture for an industrial transportation system. The motivating quality attributes to develop this innovative architecture were flexibility and openness. Taking these quality attributes into account, we proposed a decentralized architecture using multiagent systems (MASs). A MAS consists of multiple autonomous entities that coordinate with each other to achieve decentralized control. The typical advantages attributed to such decentralized architecture are flexibility and openness, the motivating quality attributes to apply MAS in this case. The architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) was used to provide insights whether our architecture meets the expected flexibility and openness, and to identify tradeoffs with other quality attributes. Applying the ATAM proved to be a valuable experience. One of the main outcome of applying the ATAM was the identification of a tradeoff between flexibility and communication load that results from the use of a decentralized architecture. This paper describes our experiences in applying the ATAM to a MAS architecture, containing both the main outcomes of the evaluation and a critical reflection on the ATAM itself. (36 refs)

Abstract: Component-based approaches to elaborate software must deal with the fact that in practical settings, components information may be incomplete, imprecise and uncertain, and requirements may be likewise. Architects wanting to evaluate candidate architectures regarding requirements satisfaction need to use whatever information available about components, however imperfect. Imperfect information can be dealt with using specialized analytical formalisms, such as fuzzy values for imprecision and rough sets for incompleteness; but if used, evaluations need to compare and rank using non-scalar, non-symbolic values. This article presents an approach to systematically describe components� imperfect information, and to evaluate and rank whole component assemblies, by using credibility values-based �support scores� that aggregate imperfect information about requirements, mechanisms and components. The approach builds on the Azimut framework, which offers progressive refinement of architectural entities via architectural policies, architectural mechanisms, components, and component assemblies. An example of the proposed approach and �what-if� analysis are illustrated. (28 refs)

Abstract: Nowadays it is widely recognized the crucial role played in the software development process by the analysis of extra-functional properties (and especially performance) at the architectural level. To foster this kind of quantitative analysis we envisage the need to transform the performance model generation and analysis into a rigorous and sound discipline. To this end we intend to exploit the knowledge (acquired by other disciplines) in the area of model transformation, and import both reasoning and methodologies in the software performance engineering. In this paper we investigate the area of performance model derivation and analysis focusing on model transformation; we propose an initial taxonomy for the area of performance analysis at software architecture level and we delineate our suggestions towards a software performance model driven engineering.

Abstract: When engineering complex and distributed software and hardware systems (increasingly used in many sectors, such as manufacturing, aerospace, transportation, communication, energy and health-care), dependability has became a must, since failures can have economics consequences and can also endanger human life. Software architectures (SA) can help improving the overall system dependability, providing a system blueprint that can be validated and that can guide all phases of the system development. Even if much work has been done on this direction, three important topics require major investigation: how different analysis techniques can be integrated together, how results obtained with SA-based analysis can be related to requirements and coding, and how to integrate new methodologies in the industrial software development life-cycle. In this paper we propose an architecture-centric analysis process which allows formal analysis driven by model-based architectural specifications. This analysis process satisfies the industrial requirements, since it is tool supported and based on semi-formal (UML-based) specifications. (33 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. The tutorial consists of two parts. In the first part (45 min), Ralf Reussner focuses on the importance of an explicitly modelled software architecture. Besides an introduction into common architectural views, the role of the software architect is compared to �classical building� architects. As part of this, the often used comparison between building architecture and software architecture is critically reviewed. In particular, the role of an architect is discussed in model-driven software projects. During the second part of the tutorial (135 min), Steffen Becker demonstrates online model driven development tools based on Eclipse. First, an introduction is given on the metamodelling tools of the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) and on the Graphical Modelling Framework (GMF) used to generate a domain specific editors for user defined (meta-)models. Additionally, the MDA framework of the OMG is presented and the concepts are applied to the introduced tools. A live demonstration of the capabilities of the introduced tools for model transformations shows finally how a domain specific modelling tool can be generated to a large extend automatically using an EMF-model instance and the generator of GMF. As a result, an editor based on the Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) can be deployed and run using Eclipse. (0 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. Software architecture has become a widely-accepted conceptual basis for the development of non-trivial software in all application areas and by organizations of all sizes. Effectively documenting an architecture is as important as crafting it; if the architecture is not understood, or worse, misunderstood, it cannot meet its goals as the unifying vision for software development. Development-based architecture strategies, such as Rational�s Unified Process, stop short of prescribing documentation standards. The views and beyond approach to software architecture provides practical guidance on the what, why, and how of creating IEEE 1471-2000 compliant documentation for your software architecture that will be used for years to come. The approach is based on the well-known concept of views and is presented in the context of prevailing prescriptive models for architecture, including the Unified Process and UML 2.0, which has improved support for representing key architectural elements over its predecessors.

Abstract: Short innovation cycles in software and hardware make architecture design a key issue in future development processes for embedded systems. The basis for architectural design decisions is a transparent architecture evaluation. Our model-based approach supports a uniform representation of hierarchies of quality attributes and an integration of different architecture evaluation techniques and methods. We present a metamodel for architecture evaluation as a basis for the precise description of the quality attribute structure and the evaluation methodology. By modelling architecture evaluation, the relationships between architectural elements and quality attributes and interdependences between quality attributes can be represented and investigated. Thereby, the architecture exploration process with its evaluations, decisions, and optimizations is made explicit, traceable, and analyzable. (20 refs)

Abstract: Performance predictions based on design documents aim at improving the quality of software architectures. In component-based architectures, it is difficult to specify the performance of individual components, because it depends on the deployment context of a component, which may be unknown to its developers. The way components are used influences the perceived performance, but most performance prediction approaches neglect this influence. In this paper, we present a specification notation based on annotated UML diagrams to explicitly model the influence of parameters on the performance of a software component. The UML specifications are transformed into a stochastical model that allows the prediction of response times as distribution functions. Furthermore, we report on a case study performed on an online store. The results indicate that more accurate predictions could be obtained with the newly introduced specification and that the method was able to support a design decision on the architectural level in our scenario. � 2006 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Service-based software architectures are often modeled with queues and queuing networks. Such models are useful for performance evaluation and design. They can also assist in runtime maintenance and administration, but, in this context, it is often far more valuable to be able to forecast how QoS characteristics are likely to evolve in the near future. This is particularly important in cases where systems can be adapted to counter QoS constraint violations: in such systems, given predictions of likely future QoS characteristics, pre-emptive adaptation strategies can be implemented. This paper outlines an approach to runtime prediction of QoS characteristics of queued systems. Predictions are computed by applying ARIMA forecasting techniques to basic properties of a queued model, and then using the model to predict complex QoS characteristics. We outline how our methods integrate into our implementation framework for monitoring and pre-emptive adaptation of web service based systems. � 2006 Springer-Verlag. (19 refs)

The scenario framework provides an effective means of formulating safety concerns. The mitigation action model facilitates exploitation and codification of existing safety-critical system design knowledge. Finally, we present a series of steps that enable the justification of architectural design decisions that refine both requirements and architectures. We demonstrate and discuss the application of our framework by means of a case study. � 2006 Springer-Verlag. (19 refs)

Abstract: Making software developers work towards a common goal may be likened to herding cats. If we further spread developers around the globe, we run increased risks of being unable to design and impose coherent software architectures on projects, potentially leading to lower quality of the resulting systems. Based on our experiences in a large, distributed research and development project, PalCom, we propose that employing techniques from active user involvement in general (and from participatory design in particular) may help in designing and sharing quality software architectures. In particular, we present the Traveling Architects technique in which a group of architects visit development locations in order to engage developers and end users in software architecture work. We argue that using techniques such as these may potentially lead to higher quality of software architectures in particular for systems developed in a distributed setting. � 2006 Springer-Verlag.

Abstract: Middleware architectures play a crucial role in determining the overall quality of many distributed applications. Systematic evaluation methods for middleware architectures are therefore important to thoroughly assess the impact of design decisions on quality goals. This paper presents MEMS, a scenario-based evaluation approach. MEMS provides a principled way of evaluating middleware architectures by leveraging generic qualitative and quantitative evaluation techniques such as prototyping, testing, rating, and analysis. It measures middleware architectures by rating multiple quality attributes, and the outputs aid the determination of the suitability of alternative middleware architectures to meet an application�s quality goals. MEMS also benefits middleware development by uncovering potential problems at early stage, making it cheaper and quicker to fix design problems. The paper describes a case study to evaluate the security architecture of grid middleware architectures for managing secure conversations and access control. The results demonstrate the practical utility of MEMS for evaluating middleware architectures for multiple quality attributes. � 2006 Springer-Verlag. (26 refs)

Abstract: Architectural knowledge consists of architecture design as well as the design decisions, assumptions, context, and other factors that together determine why a particular solution is the way it is. Except for the architecture design part, most of the architectural knowledge usually remains hidden, tacit in the heads of the architects. We conjecture that an explicit representation of architectural knowledge is helpful for building and evolving quality systems. If we had a repository of architectural knowledge for a system, what would it ideally contain, how would we build it, and exploit it in practice? In this paper we describe a use-case model for an architectural knowledge base, together with its underlying ontology. We present a small case study in which we model available architectural knowledge in a commercial tool, the Aduna Cluster Map Viewer, which is aimed at ontology-based visualization. Putting together ontologies, use cases and tool support, we are able to reason about which types of architecting tasks can be supported, and how this can be done. � 2006 Springer-Verlag. (27 refs)

Abstract: To deliver complex functionalities in a cost effective manner, embedded software should ideally be developed with standardized interoperable components. At the same time, most of these embedded systems must be demonstrably safe and reliable. This paper aims to extend SaveCCM, a modelling language for component-based embedded systems, with standard safety evaluation models. Based on this extension, failure and hazard probabilities can be estimated early in the development process and can be used to check if a system can fulfil its safety requirements. The procedure of the safety evaluation is demonstrated with the case study of a computer assisted braking system. � 2006 Springer-Verlag. (34 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. Composability itself is probably the least composable term in the theory of computer science. In this talk, I�ll explore some of the troubling reasons why we have succeeded only so-so when it comes to the creation of composable software - and thus software components. Architecture can often come to the rescue, but only when applied with great style. (0 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. A software architecture describes the structure of a software system on an abstract implementation independent level. In forward engineering it serves as a blueprint to prescribe the intended software structure (so-called architecture model). In reverse engineering it can provide an abstract view of the actual code structure of the existing software system (so-called code architecture). Architecture models and actual code architectures play a vital role for all comprehension and communication tasks during the development and evolution of large software systems. Therefore, architecture models and code architectures have to be explicitly represented and consistently maintained during the development, maintenance, and reengineering processes. The need to insure compliance of the architecture model and the actual code architecture has drawn considerable attention in recent years. In order to facilitate maintainability and enhancement of a software system the compliance of the architecture model and the actual code architecture is essential. Various tools have been developed to analyse and evaluate the deviation of code architecture and architecture model. In this tutorial we present static analysis tools that may be used for architectural analyses. We demonstrate how these tools can create useful architectural views for different evaluation tasks such as identification of reconstruction scope, critical architectural elements and potential design irregularities. If possible we will analyse a software system provided by a participant of the workshop in a life demonstration. (0 refs)

Abstract: Summary form only given. Software product families have found broad adoption in the embedded systems industry. Product family thinking has been prevalent in this context for mechanics and hardware and adopting the same for software has been viewed as a logical approach. During recent years, however, the trends of convergence, end-to-end solutions, shortened innovation and R&D cycles and differentiator through software engineering capabilities have lead to a development where organizations are stretching the scope of their product families far beyond the initial design. Failing to adjust the product family approach, including the architectural and process dimensions when the business strategy is changing is leading to several challenging problems that can be viewed as symptoms of this approach. The keynote discusses the key symptoms, the underlying causes for these symptoms as well as solutions for realigning the product family approach with the business strategy. (0 refs)
