Abstract: Embedded systems typically operate in resource-constrained environments and often find themselves in difficult to access locations, making system maintenance expensive and the management of quality difficult to achieve. The service-oriented model of deployment offers a potential solution to these challenges as it allows for software systems to be dynamically composed and reconfigured using services discoverable at runtime. However, the resource contention between services on the orchestration platform can cause significant falls in Quality of Service (QoS). This emergent QoS is difficult to anticipate before deployment as changes in QoS are often dynamic and influenced by many factors. This paper presents EQoSystem, a resource-aware architecture combining resource monitoring with dynamic workflow management and service orchestration. We demonstrate the efficacy of EQoSystem using a medium-sized case study deployed on an embedded platform. The results show that continuous and effective resource management changes can be made to maintain resource consumption within preset thresholds. � 2012 IEEE. (25 refs)

Abstract: In component-based software engineering, software architectures govern not only software development but also software evolution. Indeed, to efficiently and accurately manage software evolution and guarantee its quality, architecture models should be at the core of the evolution process, be accurately synchronized with the runtime systems and have their changes and version information be completely tracked. As architecture models are often captured by ADLs (Architecture Description Languages), an ADL supporting architecture-centric evolution is required. In this paper, we study how architecture-centric evolution can be supported by the Dedal ADL. We thus propose a dedicated CDL (Change Description Language) which models architectural changes as first-class entities and describes them from a semantic viewpoint. � 2012 IEEE. (25 refs)

Abstract: A central aspect of architecting is architecture description. Architecture descriptions take many forms and serve many purposes throughout the life cycle of development, operation and maintenance activities. The use of multiple views - diverse representations for distinct audiences and uses - has been a major tenet of architecture description since the earliest work in software architecture. This tenet has been codified in various ways. Most practising software architects must operate within the confines of a prescribed architecture framework (AF) or architecture description language (ADL) as dictated by their organization or client. Current AFs and ADLs are defined with varying degrees of rigour and offer varying levels of tool support, furthermore, these resources are often closed, making it difficult for the architect to tailor a representational solution to the specific challenges of the project at hand. In this paper we propose an automated infrastructure to support the architecture description-related activities of the architect. This infrastructure facilitates customization, composition and reuse of the architect�s representational resources (AFs, ADLs and their constituents) to meet project-, domain- and organization-specific needs. The proposed approach builds upon the conceptual foundations of ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 for architecture description. The approach has been evaluated in the context of a complex, real-world, public transportation system. � 2012 IEEE. (32 refs)

Abstract: Managing the cost-effective evolution of industrial software systems is a challenging task because of their complexity and long lifetimes. Limited pro-active evolution planning and software architecture erosion often lead to huge maintenance costs in such systems. However, formerly researched approaches for evolution scenario analysis and architecture enforcement are only reluctantly applied by practitioners due to their perceived overhead and high costs. We have applied several recent sustainability evaluation and improvement approaches in a case study to the software architecture of a large industrial software system currently under development at ABB. We combined our selection of approaches in a lightweight method called MORPHOSIS, for which this paper presents experiences and lessons learned. We found that reasonable sustainability evaluation and improvement is possible already with limited efforts. � 2012 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: Decentralized systems are systems-of-systems whose services are governed by two or more separate organizations under distinct spheres of authority. Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any\  one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services. COAST combines mechanisms from software architecture, cryptography, security, and programming languages, granting application architects flexible provisioning of their core services and assets while protecting those services and assets from attack and misuse. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Architectural recovery techniques analyze a software system�s implementation-level artifacts to suggest its likely architecture. However, different techniques will often suggest different architectures for the same system, making it difficult to interpret these results and determine the best technique without significant human intervention. Researchers have tried to assess the quality of recovery techniques by comparing their results with authoritative recoveries: meticulous, labor-intensive recoveries of existing well-known systems in which one or more engineers is integrally involved. However, these engineers are usually not a system�s original architects or even developers. This carries the risk that the authoritative recoveries may miss domain-, application-, and system context-specific information. To deal with this problem, we propose a framework comprising a set of principles and a process for recovering a system�s ground-truth architecture. The proposed recovery process ensures the accuracy of the obtained architecture by involving a given system�s architect or engineer in a limited, but critical fashion. The application of our work has the potential to establish a set of �ground truths� for assessing existing and new architectural recovery techniques. We illustrate the framework on a case study involving Apache Hadoop. � 2012 IEEE. (14 refs)

Abstract: One of the approaches for documenting software architecture is to treat it as a set of architectural design decisions. Such decisions are always made in the context of requirements that must be fulfilled and in the context of decisions that were made before. Currently, models for representing architectural decisions are mainly concentrated on showing the decision making process of the initial architectural design. However, decisions that have been made in such a process may need to be changed during further evolution and maintenance of the software architecture, typically in response to the new or changed requirements. A graphical modelling notation for documenting architectural decisions (Maps of Architectural Decisions) has been developed by our team. In this paper, it is presented how this notation could be used to model architectural decisions under changing requirements. It is proposed how one decision change could be effectively propagated through the rest of the architectural decision model and how a rigorous and tool-supported process of updating such models could be organized. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Practices designed to expedite the delivery of stakeholder value can paradoxically lead to unexpected rework costs that ultimately degrade the flow of value over time. This is especially observable when features are developed based on immediate value, while dependencies that may slow down future development efforts are neglected. The technical debt metaphor conceptualizes this tradeoff between short-term and long-term value: taking shortcuts to optimize the delivery of features in the short term incurs debt, analogous to financial debt, that must be paid off later to optimize long-term success. In this paper, we describe taking an architecture-focused and measurement-based approach to develop a metric that assists in strategically managing technical debt. Such an approach can be used to optimize the cost of development over time while continuing to deliver value to the customer. We demonstrate our approach by describing its application to an ongoing system development effort. � 2012 IEEE. (31 refs)

Abstract: We propose a novel approach that merges implied scenarios and race condition analysis techniques, to systematically detect and analyse security-related vulnerabilities at the architectural level. We apply our approach to an industrial case related to architecting systems interfacing the cloud. The application demonstrates an effective use of the approach, where the approach has detected securityrelated vulnerabilities in the architecture due to unexpected modes of interactions in such environment. Our approach was able to guide testers to detect critical security scenarios, which were not perceived during the inception phases or not captured using either of implied scenarios or race conditions detection techniques alone. We reflect on its applicability and scalability. We look into possible usage scenarios related to architectural-level testing for security and incremental refinements of the architecture following the detection of security vulnerabilities. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Product line engineering is an approach that works well for managing the anticipated variability of software systems as demonstrated in numerous studies. However, little empirical research and few approaches exist for dealing with the unanticipated evolution of product lines. As a result, the understanding of product line evolution is still weak and the maturity of approaches and tools supporting evolution is often insufficient. In this paper we present results of a case study on impact analyses and desired tool support in product line evolution. Our findings are based on observing 30 person months of development. We analyzed changes made to a product line in typical evolution scenarios by involving the key developers. We used empirical data on observed development activities and impact analyses to derive a trace information model showing frequently desired trace links. We discuss lessons learned and implications for tool developers. � 2012 IEEE. (46 refs)

Abstract: Business and design decisions regarding software development should be based on data, not opinions among developers, domain experts or managers. The company running the most and fastest experiments among the customer base against the lowest cost per experiment outcompetes others by having the data to engineer products with outstanding qualities such as power consumption and user experience. Innovation experiment systems for mass-produced devices with embedded software is an evolution of current R&D practices, going from where innovations are internally evaluated by the original equipment manufacturer to where they are tried by real users in a scale relevant to the full customer base. The turnaround time from developing and deploying an embedded product to getting customer feedback is decreased to weeks, the limit being the speed of the software development teams. The paper presents an embedded architecture for realising such a novel innovation experiment system based on a set of scenarios of what to evaluate in the experiments. A case is presented implementing an architecture in a prototype in-vehicle infotainment system where comparative testing between two software alternatives was performed. � 2012 IEEE. (9 refs)

Abstract: A common approach to software architecture documentation in industry projects is the use of file-based documents. This approach offers a single-dimensional perspective on the architectural knowledge contained. Knowledge retrieval from file-based architecture documentation is efficient if the perspective chosen fits the needs of the readers, it is less so if the perspective does not match the needs of the readers. In this paper we describe an approach aimed at addressing architecture documentation retrieval issues. We have employed a software ontology in a semantic wiki optimized for architecture documentation. We have evaluated this ontology-based approach in a controlled industry experiment involving software professionals. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is found to be better than that of the file-based approach. � 2012 IEEE. (29 refs)

Abstract: Many of today�s enterprise software systems are subject to variability. For example, enterprise software systems often run in different business units of an organization, with each unit having its own detailed requirements. Systematic handling of variability allows a software system to be adjusted for different contexts, by planning for adaptation during architecture design. As variability is system-wide, it is reflected in the software architecture. To facilitate the representation and analysis of variability in the architecture of enterprise software systems, we propose an architecture viewpoint. To define a reusable variability viewpoint, we elicited stakeholders and concerns through exploratory studies. We also show how the viewpoint was applied for describing variability in a large-scale e-government system. � 2012 IEEE. (10 refs)

Abstract: As the software for avionics becomes more complex, the challenge to provide the required reliability and safety mechanisms becomes also more complex. Embracing the ARINC 650 and 653 standards to provide a means to embark several systems into a single hardware cabinet opens the door to the development of even more elaborated software avionics systems, by overcoming the space constraints once found in this kind of system. Nevertheless, ARINC 653 exhibits also some limitations regarding fault redundancy management, especially when handling redundant applications with spares that back up other applications. In this paper, a framework to support fault tolerance and reconfiguration in avionics systems under the umbrella of ARINC 653 standard is described. This paper represents part of the results of the research projects carried out during the last two years by Eurocopter Espana in collaboration with the University of Castilla-La Mancha. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Formal modelling techniques are often disregarded as their semantics are too distant from the mainstream practice of software architecture design, which is dominated by the use of component based modelling and patterns. This paper advocates the need for formal modelling techniques for humans, i.e., software architects who need to precisely ascertain the security properties of their design models. We contribute a technique that enables architects to more easily construct verified, secure architecture designs by assembling already verified security pattern models. Our approach is illustrated with a pattern language for accountability. It is validated by an observational study that shows that the approach produces reusable results, and is able to uncover relevant architectural security flaws. � 2012 IEEE. (15 refs)

Abstract: Software product line engineering aims at increasing software quality and development productivity by mastering the variability of large software systems. Models are frequently used to define the reusable assets and the restrictions regarding asset composition in different products. However, product line engineering is challenged by evolution. Reusable assets such as software components need to be adapted to meet new customer or market requirements as well as technological needs. In this paper we present an approach that supports the maintenance of product line models by checking their consistency with the available components. We describe algorithms and heuristics for creating and updating the models defining a product line�s features and components. We evaluate our approach using realistic change scenarios from a product line of time recorder applications. � 2012 IEEE. (29 refs)

Abstract: Offering services in the internet requires a dependable operation of the underlying software systems with guaranteed quality of service. The workload of such systems typically significantly varies throughout a day and thus leads to changing resource utilisations. Existing system monitoring tools often use fixed threshold values to determine if a system is in an unexpected state. Especially in low load situations, deviations from the system�s expected behaviour are detected too late if fixed value thresholds (leveled for peak loads) are used. In this paper, we present our approach of a workload-aware performance monitoring process based on performance prediction techniques. This approach allows early detections of performance problems before they become critical. We applied our approach to the e-mail system operated by Germany�s largest e-mail provider, the 1&1 Internet AG. This case study demonstrates the applicability of our approach and shows its accuracy in the predicted resource utilisation with an error of mostly less than 10%. � 2012 IEEE. (23 refs)

Abstract: Documenting and maintaining the traceability between architectural models and code is one of the foremost challenges of model-based software development. Yet, traceability is rarely captured immediately while models and code co-evolve but usually recovered later. By then key people may have moved on or their recollection of facts may be blurred or inconsistent. In previous work, we proposed a language for capturing traceability that allows for uncertainty and incompleteness. This paper investigates this language on the unique properties that characterize model-to-code traceability. Our approach takes ambiguous, incomplete, and possibly incorrect assumptions about the traceability between model and code as input. It then validates the correctness of these assumptions and completes the input by inserting their logical consequences. This paper demonstrates the correctness and scalability of our approach which has been validated on several third-party software systems. Our approach is automated and fully tool supported. � 2012 IEEE. (38 refs)

Abstract: Software architecture has been proven as a conceptual tool to manage the development and evolution of a software product. However, integrating architecting as an activity in software engineering is still perceived as a major challenge in practice. Our observation from many projects centered around architecture is that most organizations actually fail to plan architecting activities and align them in product development. The consequence is that the value of the architecture is underrated and the power of architecture remains more often than not unexploited. In this paper, we introduce the notion of architecture engagement purpose - an auxiliary construct to align architecting with other engineering activities in the product lifecycle. We gained first promising results in applying it in industrial projects, where explicit architecture engagement purposes enabled the organization in planning and tracking architecting as an activity within their software engineering. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) concisely express the essential features of system designs. However, using a DSL for automated analysis and code generation requires developing specialized tools. We describe how to create model analysis and code generation tools that can be applied to a large family of DSLs, and show how we created the LIGHT platform, a suite of such tools for the family of software architecture-based DSLs. These tools can be easily reused off-the-shelf with new DSLs, freeing engineers from having to custom-develop them. The key innovation underlying our strategy is to enhance DSL metamodels with additional semantics, and then automatically synthesize configurations and plug-ins for flexible analysis and code generation frameworks. Our evaluation shows that, for a DSL of typical size, using our strategy relieves software engineers of developing approximately 17,500 lines of code, which amounts to several person-months of programming work. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Software designers frequentlynd the need to refactor existing code to improve the structure of their design. Typical examples include the application of design patterns or splitting large modules into smaller ones. The problem lies in the difficulty in evaluating the effect of such restructuring before developers implement their newly proposed design ideas. Such experimental implementation can be expensive because it may include potential con icts or cause unnecessary source code branching to occur. It can be even more expensive if the designer needs to compare multiple design alternatives. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate the possibility of simulating structural design changes based on Baldwin and Clark�s modular operators. This simulation permits designers to explore the design space and validate ideas for software changes without having to implement them concretely. � 2012 IEEE. (9 refs)

Abstract: Reference architectures have emerged as a special type of software architecture that achieves well-recognized understanding of specific domains, promoting reuse of design expertise and facilitating the development, standardization, and evolution of software systems. Designed for various domains and purpose, they have increasingly impacted important aspects of system development, such as productivity and quality of such systems. However, reference architectures have been sometimes established without an adequate concern about which elements they should encompass. Besides that, there is a lack of work that investigate the essence of reference architectures, their dimensions and elements that they should contain. In this perspective, the main contribution of this paper is to present a reference model for reference architectures, named RAModel (Reference Architecture Model), that intends to improve the understanding about what reference architectures are, as well as their components and relationships, supporting the establishment, use, and evolution of such architectures. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Big data phenomenon refers to the practice of collection and processing of very large data sets and associated systems and algorithms used to analyze these massive datasets. Architectures for big data usually range across multiple machines and clusters, and they commonly consist of multiple special purpose sub-systems. Coupled with the knowledge discovery process, big data movement offers many unique opportunities for organizations to benefit (with respect to new insights, business optimizations, etc.). However, due to the difficulty of analyzing such large datasets, big data presents unique systems engineering and architectural challenges. In this paper, we present three system design principles that can inform organizations on effective analytic and data collection processes, system organization, and data dissemination practices. The principles presented derive from our own research and development experiences with big data problems from various federal agencies, and we illustrate each principle with our own experiences and recommendations. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Approaches for sharing and reusing architectural knowledge (AK) have found some application in practice. Capturing AK during software design and development, however, is still a problem. Main reasons are the effort involved in capturing, as well as lack of time and budget, and lack of short-term benefits for the involved stakeholders. We propose using context information about currently modified artifacts, like time, existing relations, and user information, for automatically identifying and presenting relevant AK. The main aim is to simplify the use of AK during development by presenting a continuously updated context-relevant view on AK for currently viewed artifacts. This facilitates capturing and maintaining of relations among knowledge entities, updating existing entities, and finding relevant entities during architecture analysis and reviews. In this paper we present the main concepts of our approach, report on first experiences, and discuss future work. � 2012 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: Architecture Description Languages usually specify software architectures in the levels of types and instances. Components instantiate component types by parameterization and type conformance. Behavioral analysis of dynamic architectures needs to deal with the uncertainty of actual configurations of components, even if the type-level architectural descriptions are explicitly provided. This paper addresses this verification difficulty for connector-based architecture styles, in which all communication channels of a system are between components and a connector. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) We propose a process-algebraic model, in which the main architectural concepts (such as component type and component conformance) and several fundamental architectural properties (i.e.~deadlock-freedom, non-starvation, conservation, and completeness) are formulated. (2) We demonstrate that the state space of verification of these properties can be reduced from the entire universe of possible configurations to specific configurations that are fixed according to the type-level architectural descriptions. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: While the performance analysis of a software architecture is a quite well-assessed task nowadays, the issue of interpreting the performance results for providing feedback to software architects is still very critical. This is mostly due to the gap between results representation (i.e. mean values, variances, and/or probability distributions) and expected feedback (i.e. architectural alternatives). Performance antipatterns represent effective instruments to tackle this issue, because they document common mistakes leading to performance problems as well as their solutions. In this paper we present a model-driven approach that enables performance antipatterns to arise in the context of an ADL-based software architecture. Such approach automatically detects them in AEmilia, i.e. an ADL allowing the performance evaluation of software systems. The approach has been applied to a case study, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. � 2012 IEEE. (20 refs)

Abstract: During the architecture development process, architectural design decisions play an important role in maintaining non-functional properties of the system. Instead of supposing that architectural decisions are implicitly recognizable, existing works propose to give them first-class status. However, little focus is paid on the automation of architectural decision checking. This paper proposes to leverage pattern formalization techniques to document architectural decisions. The approach consists of a way to describe architectural patterns that hold the architectural decision definition, show how to integrate architectural decisions (patterns) into an architectural model and finally automate the architectural decision conformance checking. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: In this paper, the notion of forces as influences upon architecture decisions is introduced. To facilitate the documentation of forces as a part of architecture descriptions, we specify a decision forces viewpoint, which extends our existing framework for architecture decisions, following the conventions of the international architecture description standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. The applicability of the viewpoint was validated in three case studies, in which senior software engineering students used it to document decisions in software projects, two of which conducted for industrial customers. The results show that the forces viewpoint is a well-received documentation approach, satisfying stakeholder concerns related to traceability between decision forces and architecture decisions. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Effective variability support has become an important attribute of modern software development practices. Organizations show an increasing interest in the development of software applications using software platforms, reusable components, and mass customization. Even though many variability management tools exist, an approach that integrates support for variability management (e.g. features, decisions, variation points, and variants) directly into architecture models is still missing. Making variability concepts an integral part of architecture models has many benefits. Variability management and architecture development can be integrated into one consistent information model and development environment supporting full traceability of architectural artifacts (e.g. requirements, features, components) on all levels of the development lifecycle. In this paper we show how we integrated orthogonal variability modeling and feature modeling into LISA, an approach and toolkit for architecture management and analysis. Variability management is no longer a separate activity but an integral part of the architecture development lifecycle. � 2012 IEEE. (22 refs)

Abstract: An organisation that had developed a large Information System wanted to embark on a programme of significant evolution for the system. As a precursor to this, it was decided to create a comprehensive architectural description. This undertaking faced a number of challenges, including a low general awareness of software modelling and software architecture practices. The approach taken for this project included the definition of a simple, specific, architecture description language. This paper describes the experiences of the project and the ADL created as part of it. � 2012 IEEE. (15 refs)

Abstract: In almost any other field than software development, the World Wide Web, or simply the Web has revolutionized collaboration by providing a platform for cooperative applications and services. In contrast, so far revision control, also referred to as version management, has been the key technology for enabling collaborative software development. However, even today it is feasible to build a cooperative development environment that runs in a cloud, following the spirit of Google Docs, where developers can cooperate in real time. In this paper, we take a step beyond from the design of the technical artifact that allows collaborative coding, and consider the consequences of such an approach to software development in a more general sense, in particular from the perspective of version management. The goal is to integrate collaborative development with traditional facilities commonly associated with software engineering. This in turn will lead to a development approach where new opportunities complement tools that are known to work and provide a lot of added value in software development Copyright 2012 ACM. (15 refs)

Abstract: In this position paper, we present a vision towards supporting developers to better make use of architectural abstractions by providing �just-in-time� access to architectural knowledge. The concept presented in this paper is based on two main pillars: 1. Onthe-fly access to �living� artifacts (such as code, user stories, project plans, etc.) with intelligent filtering and selection 2. Interactive presentation of architectural knowledge beyond static documentation of facts. Interactive searching, browsing and selecting relevant information in combination with intelligent decision support functions need to be installed into modern development environments which results in technical as well as social challenges. In this position paper, we sketch a vision pursuing the goal to make architectural knowledge easily accessible for every developer, especially when drowning in systemic implementation challenges.

Abstract: Cloud computing has captured the attention of both the researchers and practitioners alike. Companies and other cloud users are expecting to receive significant benefits from the new cloud based technologies. To what extent these benefits materialize for enterprise IT is not clearly understood. In this paper, we examine the perceived benefits of cloud computing from the cloud users� perspectives. Cloud users include users of SaaS/PaaS/IaaS, ranging from end-users, to service developers and system administrators. Using content analysis techniques, weexamine one of the major discussion forums of cloud computing. Rather than offering a yes/no answer to the question posed, we offer five empirically drawn insights on the perceived benefits of cloud computing. It is proposed that the empirical insights gained are valuable to both researchers and practitioners. The value lies in a more holistic view on the promised benefits� landscape. Copyright 2012 ACM.

Abstract: This paper describes an implementation of the Infrastructure-as-a- Service (IaaS) concept for scientific computing and seven service pilot implementations with requirements from biomedical use cases at the CSC - IT Center for Science. The key service design requirements were enabling the use of any scientific software environment the use cases needed to succeed, and delivering the distributed infrastructure ICT resources seamlessly with the local ICT resources for the scientist users. The service concept targets the IT administrators at research organisations and delivers virtualised compute cluster and storage capacity via private network solutions. The virtualised resources can become part of the local cluster as virtual nodes and they can share the same file system as the physical nodes assuming the network performance is sufficient. Extension of the local resources can then be made transparent to enable an easy infrastructure uptake to the scientist end-users. Based on 20 months of service piloting most of the biomedical organisations express a sustained and growing need for the distributed compute and storage resources delivered with the IaaS. We conclude that a successful implementation of the IaaS can improve access and reduce the effort to run expensive ICT infrastructure needed for biomedical research Copyright 2012 ACM. (16 refs)

Abstract: Recently, software developers are faced with a fierce market competition with: diverse market needs, ever increasing number of features, and shortening product life cycle. To survive in this fierce competition, software developers are searching for methods and tools to develop various products with reduced time-to-market and improved quality. In response to these needs, we present a new CASE called VULCAN. VULCAN is a software development workbench comprising various tools for supporting the entire phases of feature-oriented product line software development from feature modeling to asset and product development. Especially, it provides several tools for supporting architecture-model-based software development where: (1) product line architectures can be specified using various architecture patterns, (2) application-specific architectures can be derived from the product line architecture specifications, (3) application-specific control components can be generated from the application rchitecture specifications, and (4) different deployment architectures can be configured with various component communication mechanisms. Of various tools included in VULCAN, we focus on this tool set for supporting architecture-model-based software development in this paper and demonstration. Copyright 2012 ACM. (15 refs)

Abstract: The concept of variability is fundamental in software product lines and a successful implementation of a product line largely depends on how well domain requirements and their variability are specified, managed, and realized. While developing an educational software product line, we identified a lack of support to specify variability in quality concerns. To address this problem we propose an approach to model variability in quality concerns, which is an extension of quality attribute scenarios. In particular, we propose domain quality attribute scenarios, which extend standard quality attribute scenarios with additional information to support specification of variability and deriving product specific scenarios. We demonstrate the approach with scenarios for robustness and upgradability requirements in the educational software product line. Copyright 2012 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: The paper presents a document template for reference architectures for the domain of software-intensive embedded systems. The template addresses the somewhat conflicting needs when documenting a reference architecture of readability, overview, details, evolution and different background of the stakeholders. The first novel idea is the template prescribes two separate documents describing a reference architecture beside the product architecture documentation. The information in the two documents concern different stakeholders and evolve at different paces. The other novelty in describing reference architectures is to introduce a perspective of time, in the form of horizons, rather than focusing on a snapshot a release date. In addition, a case is presented giving an example of how a reference architecture was documented according to the template, how stakeholder needs were captured, and how the different types of information was identified or recovered from existing product architectures.

Abstract: Modern software platforms often depend on networks of user-generated content. Although such platforms are very popular, their architectural concepts and underlying system dynamics are not yet fully understood. This paper uses stigmergy, a form of indirect communication and self-organization, as basis for framing certain groups of software services in order to propose an architectural concept of stigmergic information systems and describe identified key fields (actor base, architecture, software ecosystem) inuencing them. Thus enabling the creation of better solution stack configurations needed to support effective and efficient development of such services. Copyright 2012 ACM. (22 refs)

Abstract: Frequent itemset mining finds frequently occurring itemsets in transactional data. This is applied to diverse problems such as decision support, selective marketing, financial forecast and medical diagnosis. The cloud, computation as an utility service, allows us to crunch large mining problems. There are a number of algorithms for doing frequent itemset mining, but none are out-of-the-box suited for the cloud, requiring large data structures to be synchronized across the network. One of the best algorithms for doing frequent itemset mining is the known FP-growth (Frequent Patterns growth). We develop a cloud-enabled algorithmic variant for frequent itemset mining that scales with very little communication and computational overhead and even, with only one worker node, is faster than FP-growth. We develop the concept of a postfix path and show how this allows us to lower the communicational cost and leads to adjustable work sizes. This concept provides a very exible algorithmic solution that can be applied to a wide variety of different problem sizes and setups. Copyright 2012 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: Variability in software architectures, and especially dynamic variability in software architectures, calls for tool support. The complexity involved in the variability means that tools should be able to efficiently derive architectures at runtime. Our contribution is to offer concepts and an expository instantiation of Configurator-as-a-Service (CaaS). CaaS provides integrability, separation of derivation concerns, and automation.

Abstract: Scaling relational database in the cloud is one of the critical factors in the migration of applications to the cloud. It is important that applications can directly monitor fine-grained scaling performance (such as consistency-related replication delays and queryspecific response time) and specify application-specific policies for autonomic management of the scaling. However, there is no general mechanism and reusable framework and infrastructures to help this. The current facilities in cloud-hosted relational databases are also very limited in providing fine-grained and consumer-centric monitoring data. The situation is exacerbated by the complexity of the different underlying cloud technologies and the need to separate scaling policy from business logic. This paper presents an architecture framework to facilitate a consumer-centric, application-managed autonomic scaling of relational databases in cloud. The architecture framework includes a new consumer-centric monitoring infrastructure and customisable components for sensing, monitoring, analysing and actuation according to application-level scaling policies without modifying an existing application. We evaluated our framework using a modified Web 2.0 application benchmark. The results demonstrate the framework�s ability to provide application-level flexibility in achieving improved throughput, data freshness (different levels of consistency) and monetary saving.

Abstract: Cloud computing is being increasingly adopted in various domains for providing on-demand infrastructure and Software as a service (SaaS) by leveraging the utility computing model and virtualization technologies. One of the domains, where cloud computing is expected to gain huge traction is Global Software Development (GSD) that has emerged as a popular software development model. Despite several promised benefits, GSD is characterized by not only technical issues but also the complexities associated with its processes. One of the key challenges of GSD is to provide appropriate tools more efficiently and cost-effectively. Moreover, variations in tools available/used by different GSD team members can also pose challenges. We assert that providing Tools as a Service (TaaS) to GSD teams through a cloud-based infrastructure can be a promising solution to address the tools related challenges in GSD projects. Through an extensive review of the relevant literature on GSD and Cloud Computing, we have identified a set of quality attributes and potential architectural solutions for a cloud-based infrastructure that can provide TaaS to GSD teams. This paper outlines the promised benefits of TaaS to GSD teams, describes the expected quality attributes of a cloud-based infrastructure and how these quality attributes can be achieved. We also present a reference architecture for a cloud-based infrastructure to provide TaaS in GSD projects and describe its use with a detailed scenario of GSD projects. Copyright 2012 ACM. (35 refs)

Abstract: By allowing resources to be acquired on-demand and in variable amounts, cloud computing provides an appealing environment for deploying pilot projects and for performance testing of Web applications and services. However, setting up cloud environments for performance testing still requires a significant amount of manual effort. To aid performance engineers in this task, we developed a framework that integrates several common benchmarking and monitoring tools. The framework helps performance engineers to test applications under various configurations and loads. Furthermore, the framework supports dynamic server allocation based on incoming load using a response-time-aware heuristics. We validated the framework by deploying and stress-testing the MediaWiki application. An experimental evaluation was conducted aimed at comparing the response-time-aware heuristics against Amazon Auto-Scale. Copyright 2012 ACM. (13 refs)

Abstract: Within the business software domain it is crucial for a software vendor to comply to different customer requirements. Traditionally this could be done by offering different products to different customers, but because multi-tenant business software deployments use one software product to serve all customers, this is no longer possible. Software vendors have to make sure that one instance of a software product is variable enough to support all different requirements from all different customers. This ability is defined as tenant-based variability. Within this paper a conceptual model is presented, explaining the role software patterns play in solving variability implementation problems in multi-tenant business software. Different important aspects of patterns are explained, like forces and consequences and are linked to concepts in the problem domain. The paper suggests that variability patterns play a large role in addressing variability in multitenant business software and provide a valuable vocabulary for researching, reporting, thinking and communicating about variability solutions in online software products.

Abstract: The heterogeneous solutions provided by different cloud vendors have led to application interoperability and migratability issues. Companies that consume cloud services are tied to a single cloud provider due to the high costs of migrating software in the cloud. However, depending on the nature, size and interests of each company, different motivations can lead them to change their cloud provider or to have multiple providers. Several approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem, mainly based on the adoption of standards or the use of middlewares for creating an abstraction between the software and the clouds. However neither of these approaches have yet been consolidated. In this paper an alternate approach is presented for modeling and developing cloud applications, based on MDE and software adaptation techniques. The proposed solution is both cloud vendor and user friendly as it allows the former to freely define their own cloud policies, whilst users continue to be free to choose a cloud provider, even after the application has been developed.

Abstract: The number of available cloud services has recently grown considerably. Therefore, consumers demand new methods for choosing the appropriate cloud services for their needs, whereas providers require dedicated ways to correctly elicit requirements from very heterogeneous consumers. In this poster, we present the StakeCloud community platform. This will act as a cloud resources marketplace, allowing consumers to input their needs and providing them with matching cloud services. Moreover, in case the needs are not met, they can be communicated as new requirements to cloud providers. Our solution will enable easier resource identification and requirements communication in cloud systems, thus supporting both consumers and providers Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

Abstract: Cloud Computing provides an infrastructure to utilise and share both computational and data resources whilst allowing a pay-peruse model. It is useful to cost-effectively manage hardware investment or to maximise its utilisation. Cloud Computing also offers transitory access to scalable amounts of computational resources, something that is especially important due to the time and financial constraints of many user communities. The typical use cases for public clouds involve non-business critical applications, particularly where issues around security of utilization of applications or deposited data within shared public services are binding requisites. In this poster, a use case is presented illustrating how the integration of Trusted Computing technologies into an available Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform - Eucalyptus - allows the security-critical energy industry to exploit the flexibility and potential economic benefits of Cloud Computing for their business-critical applications.

Abstract: In industry, enterprises have many software systems to be modernized and made available as added-value services. Identification of migration strategies and practices for service engineering is critical for successful legacy migration, and SOA adoption in industrial setting. This paper presents the results of an interview survey on the migration strategies in industry. The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to discover the migration strategies that industrial practice adopts 2) to identify the benefits of making such strategies explicit. Results of the survey have been analyzed in terms of migration activities and the available knowledge assets. As a result, we generalize the practice of industrial migration into a Lean & Mean SOA migration strategy. In addition, the uses of the strategy pinpoint promising industry-relevant research directions. Copyright 2012 ACM. (20 refs)

Abstract: Reference architectures refer to a special type of software architecture that achieves well-recognized understanding of specific domains, promoting reuse of design expertise and facilitating the development, standardization, and evolution of software systems. Designed for various domains and purpose, they have increasingly impacted important aspects of system development, such as productivity and quality of such systems. In another perspective, variability has been considered in several research topics as a mechanism that facilitates software development and evolution. In this context, the main contribution of this paper is to present the current status regarding variability in the reference architecture engineering. It is also presented future research perspectives that could be conducted, providing new directions to the reference architecture engineering in order to become existing and new reference architectures more effective elements to the development and evolution of software-intensive systems.

Abstract: Traditionally, governmental organizations have provided many supporting services internally. For example, incoming call switching and phone exchange services were often organized as organization-specific team of few people handling the requests. Outsourcing of similar services is a trend in many organizations. In order to minimize service disruption in an outsourcing project, a major problem is to discover the knowledge of current operations. In this paper we describe how we used formal concept analysis to extract classes of mobile subscriptions in the context of a transition project where we changed the provider of our mobile services and outsourced the incoming call switching services from in-house service to a new operator.

Abstract: When changing software systems, significant effort is spent on locating the architectural elements to be changed, how they relate to the existing and new requirements, and what decisions have led to the current state of the parts of the system to evolve. Model-based approaches have proposed formal metamodels to capture different aspects of the system, e.g. requirements specified in use cases and architectural models for the component design. Existing approaches still lack in an easy-to-use way to combine information from different models. We carried out a case study evolving the CoCoME software observing what are major points for improvement. In this paper, we discuss the results of the case study giving a list of requirements for tools or approaches supporting architecture-centric and model-based software evolution. Finally, we present our graph-based approach for integrated views which can help in overcoming some of the current limitations. Copyright 2012 ACM. (14 refs)

Abstract: Variability is the ability of a software system to be changed for a specific context, in a preplanned manner. As such, to facilitate the instantiation of a software architecture the variability concern needs to be explicitly addressed. Usually, architectural concerns are represented using architecture views that are derived from the corresponding architecture viewpoints. Different software architecture viewpoints have been introduced to support the modeling, understanding, communication and analysis of the software architecture for different stakeholders. Regarding variability we can observe that this has been mainly addressed in separate variability modeling approaches. In this paper we first provide a short overview of the approaches for dealing with variability at the architecture design level and then introduce the variability viewpoint. The variability viewpoint addresses the concerns for variability and can be used to introduce variability in software architecture viewpoints. Copyright 2012 ACM. (12 refs)

Abstract: Service architectures continuously evolve as a consequence of frequent business and technical change cycles. Architecture change log data represents a source of evolution-centric information in terms of intent, scope and operationalisation to accommodate changing requirements in existing architecture. We investigate change logs in order to analyse operational representation of architecture change instances to discover an implicit evolution-centric knowledge that have been aggregating over time. Change instances from the log are formalised as a typed attributed graph with its node and edge attribution capturing change representation on architecture elements. We exploit graph matching as a knowledge discovery technique in order to i) analyse change operationalisation and its dependencies for ii) discovering recurrent change sequences in the log. We identify potentially reusable, usage-determined change patterns. Copyright 2012 ACM. (18 refs)

Abstract: Variability is the ability of a software system or artifact to be adapted for specific contexts, in a preplanned manner. Many of today�s software systems are built with variability in mind, e.g., product lines and families, self-adaptive systems, open platforms, or service-based systems that support dynamic runtime composition of web services. Variability is reflected in and facilitated through the software architecture. Also, as the software architecture is a reference point for many development activities and for achieving quality attributes, variability should be treated as a first-class and cross-cutting concern in software architecture. Therefore, the Second International Workshop on Variability in Software Architecture (VARSA 2012) aims at identifying critical challenges and progressing the state-of-the-art on variability in software architecture. VARSA 2012 is a follow-up of the First International Workshop on Variability in Software Architecture (VARSA 2011), held at WICSA 2011. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). (2 refs)

Abstract: Currently, gamification is a new trend under which all activities are subsumed that try to introduce game mechanics into non-gaming applications in order to increase user engagement, motivation, and participation. This approach is especially promising in the enterprise domain since enterprise information systems (EIS) mainly focus on efficiency aspects rather than individual long-term motivation and enjoyment. Prior research has shown that these latter variables lead to higher positive organizational outcomes, e.g., job performance. Additionally, first vendors have successfully implemented platforms for gamification. However, these platforms are designed for business-toconsumer (B2C) purposes, require high integration effort and lead to silo-based applications. Requirements for EIS strongly differ from consumer web or desktop applications. Hence, we present a generic platform for enterprise gamification. We derive an architecture for gamification systematically from serviceoriented and event-driven principles and best practices. Based on this architecture, we identify important research challenges for subsequent work. Ultimately, we validate the architecture�s feasibility in a prototypical implementation. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: In scenario-based requirement elicitation techniques such as quality attribute scenario elicitation and use case engineering, the requirements engineer is typically forced to make some implicit early architectural assumptions. These architectural assumptions represent initial architectural elements such as supposed building blocks of the envisaged system. Such implicitly specified assumptions are prone to ambiguity, vagueness, duplication, and contradiction. Furthermore, they are typically scattered across and tangled within the different scenario-based requirements. This lack of modularity hinders navigability of the requirement body as a whole. This paper discusses the need to explicitly document otherwise implicit architectural assumptions. Such an explicit intermediary between quality attribute scenarios and use cases enables the derivation and exploration of interrelations between these different requirements. This is essential to lower the mental effort required to navigate these models and facilitates a number of essential activities in the early development phases such as the selection of candidate drivers in attribute-driven design, architectural trade-off analysis and architectural change impact analysis. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: The demographics of the western world is changing: people are getting older and as a partial consequence get an increasing number of chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary disease. At the same time, healthcare systems are stressed for resources, health centers are getting larger and more distributed, and the number of healthcare professionals does not follow the trend in chronic diseases. All of this leads to a need for telemedical and mobile health applications. In a Danish context, these applications are often developed through local (innovative) initiatives with little regards for national and global (standardization) initiatives. A reason for this discrepancy is that the software architecture for national (and global) systems and standards are hard to understand, hard to develop systems based on, and hard to deploy. To counter this, we propose a software ecosystem approach for telemedicine applications, providing a framework, Net4Care, encapsulating national/global design decisions with respect to standardization while allowing for local innovation. This paper presents an analysis of existing systems, of requirements for a software ecosystem for telemedicine, and a summary of initial design decisions for the Net4Care framework. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Quantitative assessment of quality attributes (i.e., non-functional requirements, such as performance, safety or reliability) of software architectures during design supports important early decisions and validates the quality requirements established by the stakeholder. In current practice, these quality requirements are most often manually checked, which is time-consuming and error-prone due to the overwhelmingly complex designs. We propose an automated approach to assess the reliability of software architectures. It consists in extracting a Markov model from the system specification written in an Architecture Description Language (ADL). Our approach translates the specified architecture to a high-level probabilistic model-checking language, supporting system validation and quantitative reliability prediction against usage profile, component arrangement and architectural styles. We validate our approach by applying it to different architectural styles and comparing those with two different quantitative reliability assessment methods presented in the literature: the composite and the hierarchical methods. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Agreement on Non-Functional Requirements between customer and supplier is crucial to a successful IT solution delivery project. In an ideal world, stakeholders and architects cooperate to achieve their common goals in a win-win situation. In a commercial setting, however, one dominant feature often introduces powerful forces from outside the technical realm. That feature is the customer/supplier relationship, usually formalized in bidding rules or as a delivery contract. Formal customer/supplier relationships often place severe limitations on information exchange between stakeholders and architects. In this paper, we explore the effect of such limitations on the interaction of architectural design with the quantification of Non-Functional Requirements, and explore a number of avenues to deal with them. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: When using Software Architecture documents (ADs), users typically �forage� for information. However, it is little understood how they do this foraging or how to structure architecture documentation to assist them. We conducted a survey of two different groups of foragers, industry practitioner and academic AD users, to investigate issues - types of forages, foraging sequences and styles - related to task-based architectural information foraging in software architecture documents. Our results show that there were different pre-conceived ideas of what to forage for prior to the search, but during foraging there was commonly foraged information. The different groups of foragers place different emphasis on information related to quality requirements, purpose of the system, use cases, physical view and process view. Foraging sequences starting with certain information were suggested to better support understanding of the described SA. These sequences typically followed the written order of the information as dictated by the AD producers. This reinforces the critical responsibility of AD producers to structure the architectural information for understanding. Diagrams, views and design decisions were most frequently cited as supporting understanding of the SA. The main hindrance was too much text and a lack of diagrams. � 2012 IEEE. (18 refs)

Abstract: Software component identification is one of the primary challenges in component base software engineering. Typically, the identification is done by analyzing existing software artefacts. Considering object-oriented systems, many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue by identifying a component as a high cohesive and loose coupled set of classes. However, this assumption leads to two main limitations: in one hand, the focus on simple metrics like high cohesion and loose coupling will not necessarily lead to good quality components. The need of high level quality characteristics for components is crucial. On the other hand, the identified components� external structure (provided and required interfaces) is missing. As a result, the identified components can hardly be reused, composed, packaged and documented. To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper an approach for identifying components based on a fitness function to measure the quality of a component. To evaluate this function, we use quality and semantic correctness models. Also, we propose to identify the provided and required interfaces of a component. � 2012 IEEE. (16 refs)

Abstract: Nowadays the software architecture of a system is often seen as a set of design decisions providing the rationale for the system design. When designing a software architecture multiple levels of design decisions need to be considered. For example, the service-based integration of heterogeneous platforms and the development of applications on top of those integration services requires high-level as well as technology-, domain-, and application-dependent architectural decisions. In this context, we performed a series of qualitative studies following a multi-method approach. First, we conducted a systematic literature review from which we derived a pattern language for platform integration featuring 40 patterns, as well as a pattern-based architectural decision model. Then, we performed interviews with 9 platform experts from 3 companies for revising the architectural knowledge captured by the pattern language and the decision model. Finally, we participated in a case study and observed the decision-making process to validate the results further. Our observations resulted in 1) a qualitatively validated, pattern-based architectural decision model and 2) a generalized model of the different levels and stages of architectural decision making for service-based platform integration. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Although enterprises perceive the importance of change, practitioners often report that dealing with changes is still a challenge. One way of addressing change is to guide the decision making of architects using a viewpoint. This paper presents a change viewpoint that frames the concerns of architects related to change. In an attempt to better understand what the architects� concerns are and the kind of support they need for dealing with change, we have conducted a case study in the Dutch Electronic Health Record system. Based on the results of this case study, the change viewpoint, aiming at guiding the architects in their reasoning, has been defined and discussed. � 2012 IEEE. (13 refs)

Abstract: In the domain of dynamically evolving distributed systems composed of autonomous and (self-) adaptive components, the task of systematically managing the design complexity of their communication and composition is a pressing issue. This stems from the dynamic nature of such systems, where components and their bindings may appear and disappear without anticipation. To address this challenge, we propose employing separation of concerns via a mechanism of dynamic implicit bindings with implicit communication. This way, we strive for dynamically formed, implicitly interacting groups - ensembles - of autonomous components. In this context, we introduce the DEECo component model, where such bindings, as well as the associated communication, are managed in an automated way, enabling transparent handling of the dynamic changes in the system. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: We describe a research program on design techniques to enable the cost-effective construction of trustworthy systems. The focus is on single-machine systems that can be formally verified to provide desired system-wide security and safety properties. Such systems are designed as compositions of small trusted components and large untrusted components whose behaviour is constrained by an underlying formally verified OS kernel. Past work has shown that building these systems is possible, now we wish to do so in a cost effective way. A key part of doing this is to design, as early as possible, an architecture that can provide the required trustworthiness properties. The research program envisions methods, models, analyses, and patterns to create and formally analyse such architectures. We present initial work on this program and discuss the gaps and research questions that will shape future research. � 2012 IEEE. (12 refs)

Abstract: In this paper, we present industrial experiences made by combining two polarizing disciplines in software engineering: software architecture and agile software development. In particular, we show how architectural design decisions could be made, communicated, and sustained in an agile development environment by using a light-weight component framework. The concepts of the component framework have proven to be effective in addressing challenges such as connecting architectural design decisions to a system�s implementation and making the architecture tangible for the developers. This is of utmost importance when the software is delivered in accordance with agile principles, such as �working software over comprehensive documentation� or �responding to change over following a plan�. � 2012 IEEE.

Abstract: Traceability analysis is used to improve quality in the software development process. As such an analysis is complex to implement and often requires a lot of dense code that is specific to the system being traced, there is a need for a framework to express traceability analysis tasks. This paper presents the Traceability Query Language TracQL, an expressive, extensible, representation-independent, and fast domain-specific language. Known approaches do not fulfill all these requirements. We examine TracQL and compare it to other approaches on a software ageing problem, namely to detect divergence between architecture and code. The necessary TracQL code is much shorter (by a factor of 1.7) and about twice as fast as what known approaches can achieve. � 2012 IEEE. (21 refs)

Abstract: In enterprises using service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural information is used for various activities including analysis, design, governance, and quality assurance. Architectural information is created, stored and maintained in various locations like enterprise architecture management tools, design tools, text documents, and service registries/repositories. Capturing and maintaining this information manually is time-intensive, expensive and error-prone. To address this problem we present an approach for automatically extracting architectural information from an actual SOA implementation. The extracted information represents the currently implemented architecture and can be used as the basis for quality assurance tasks and, through synchronization, for keeping architectural information consistent in various other tools and locations. The presented approach has been developed for a SOA in the banking domain. Aside from presenting the main drivers for the approach and the approach itself, we report on experiences in applying the approach to different applications in this domain. � 2012 IEEE. (16 refs)
