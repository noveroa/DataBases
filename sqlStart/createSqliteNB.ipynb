This paper mainly focuses on the interference avoidance and achievable SU throughput improvement due to the QoSA approach. We present the QoSA approach and the SAS framework that incorporates the proposed approach. We also present different QoSA schemes to improve the achievable SU throughput. Simulation results validate the improvement offered by the QoSA approach in terms of interference avoidance and throughput achieved by the SU. (18 refs) added\n",
